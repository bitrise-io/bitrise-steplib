      Could make the build faster by adding `COMPILER_INDEX_STORE_ENABLE=NO` flag to the `xcodebuild` command which will disable the indexing during the build.

      Indexing is needed for

      * Autocomplete
      * Ability to quickly jump to definition
      * Get class and method help by alt clicking.

      Which are not needed in CI environment.

      **Note:** In Xcode you can turn off the `Index-WhileBuilding` feature  by disabling the `Enable Index-WhileBuilding Functionality` in the `Build Settings`.<br/>
      In CI environment you can disable it by adding `COMPILER_INDEX_STORE_ENABLE=NO` flag to the `xcodebuild` command.
    summary: Could make the build faster by disabling the indexing during the build
      run.
