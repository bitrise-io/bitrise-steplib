      A comma separated list of workflows and stage paths, which can generate artifacts.
      You need to use the `{stage}.{workflow}` syntax.
      The "dot" character is the delimiter between the stage and the workflow.

      You can use regular expressions.
      The default value (`.*`) means: get every artifact from every workflow.

      Do not forget to escape the special characters.
      If you want to match all workflow from a stage then you need to escape the `.` separator and the use the `.*` any characters regex like `{stage-name}\..*`.
