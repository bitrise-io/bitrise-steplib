title: Set Java version
summary: This Step helps you activate pre-installed Java (JDK) version on the build
  virtual machine.
description: |
  This Step is not supposed to install any Java version on the fly. You can only pick from the already installed versions.
  If you want to install other Java versions, check out [Using a Java version not installed on our Android stacks](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/infrastructure/virtual-machines/#using-a-java-version-not-installed-on-our-android-stacks).

  ### Configuring the Step
  1. In the **Java version to be set globally for the build** input, select an installed Java version you wish to use during the build run.

  ### Troubleshooting
  If the Step fails to set the Java version, you can use these [scripts](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/infrastructure/virtual-machines/#managing-java-versions) as a temporary workaround.
