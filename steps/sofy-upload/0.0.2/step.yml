  You are required to provide the Build Path and Subcription key.
  You can find your subscription key by logging into Sofy, going to Account Settings --> API Key section.
  Typically this path is generated by a previous build Step in your
  Workflow. For example:
  - The Xcode build for simulator Step generates a .app file at `$BITRISE_APP_DIR_PATH`
  - The Xcode Archive & Export for iOS Step generates a ipa file at `$BITRISE_IPA_PATH`
  - The Android Build Step generates apk file at `$BITRISE_APK_PATH`
