title: Get versionName and versionCode on Android
summary: |
  Extract the versionName and the versionCode on an Android project using a Gradle task
description: |
  Extracts the version name and the version code from the Android project. It is useful if the versionName and versionCode values are defined somewhere else. Therefore, this step uses a Gradle task to print these two values. It supports only Groovy files for now.

      Using a Gradle Wrapper (gradlew) is required, as the wrapper ensures
      that the right Gradle version is installed and used for the build.
      You can find more information about the Gradle Wrapper (gradlew),
      and about how you can generate one
      in the official guide at: [https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html).
      **The path should be relative** to the repository root. For example, `./gradlew`,
      or if it is in a sub directory, `./sub/dir/gradlew`.
