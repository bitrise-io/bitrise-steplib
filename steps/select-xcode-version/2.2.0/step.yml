      A version channel identifies a pre-installed Xcode version
      based on the version's current *stability*.

      * `-stable`: refers to the latest *stable* release version of Xcode which is installed in the Virtual Machine.
      * `-latest`: refers to the latest available Xcode version in the Virtual Machine. This can be a *beta* or a *stable* Xcode version (*stable* in case there's no beta version available).
      * `-beta`: refers to the latest *beta* version of Xcode pre-installed in the Virtual Machine.
      * Named versions (ex: `xcode-6`) refer to the latest available patch release on the VM. For example `xcode-6` means the latest available Xcode 6 version, which is at the moment `6.4`.

      Generally you should *not* use the `-beta` channel as it will fail in case there's
      no *beta* Xcode available on the Virtual Machine. This, however, can be used
      in case you want to use the latest *beta* until it gets to a stable state,
      so when this step fails you can most likely switch to the `-stable` channel.
      In every other case, if you want to use the absolutely latest Xcode version
      (which might be a beta) you should use the `-latest` channel, which will
      not fail if there's no beta version available, but rather it will use
      the latest installed stable version instead.
