  Deploy to iTunes Connect, using the
  fantastic [Deliver](https://github.com/KrauseFx/deliver)
  Ruby gem.

  **If this is the very first build** of the app
  you try to deploy to iTunes Connect then you might want to upload the first
  build manually to make sure it fulfills the initial iTunes Connect submission
  verification process.

  **Be advised** that this
  step uses a well maintained, open source tool which
  uses *undocumented and unsupported APIs* (because the current
  iTunes Connect platform does not have a documented and supported API)
  to perform the deployment.
  This means that when the API changes
  **this step might fail until the tool is updated**.

  ## Setup guide and notes

  * Register an app on iTunes Connect, on the **My Apps** page. Click on the *plus sign* and select the **New iOS App** option. This requires an **admin** account.
  * Requires an **App Store iOS distibution Provisioning Profile**
  * Every build which you want to push to iTunes Connect have to have a **unique build and version number** pair (*increment either or both before a new deploy to iTunes Connect*)

      Wait for the submission to be processed and then
      enable **TestFlight Beta Testing** for this specific version?

      If this option is disabled then this step won't wait
      for the new version to be processed on iTunes Connect
      and won't enable it for *TestFlight Beta Testing* automatically.

      *Enabling this option will wait for the submission to be
      processed which might take a couple of minutes after the
      new version is deployed to iTunes Connect*.

      **NOTE:** if this option is enabled then this step will
      fail if it can't enable TestFlight Beta Testing for the
      version, even if the version was successfully uploaded
      to iTunes Connect and only the TestFlight Beta Testing
      submission failed.
