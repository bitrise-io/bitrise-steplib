  Upload Android mapping file to Instabug through Bitrise CI.

  ### Configuring the Step
  1. Add the **Instabug Android Mapping File Upload** step to your Workflow after any build Step.
  2. Set the **build.gradle Path**. In general, it should work with the default value.
  3. Set the **Instabug App Token**. It's highly recommended to have this value in a secret env var and reference that.


  ### Troubleshooting
  Make sure you insert the Step after any build Step so that every dependency and env var is already setted.
