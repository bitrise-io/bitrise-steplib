title: Recursive touch for Cache
summary: Touches all the files in a directory
description: |-
  Touches all the files in a directory so you can keep your project's file statuses between builds.
  Put this step before any `xcodebuild` related step that uses `build`, `test` or `build-for-testing` commands, so `DerivedData` cache can work properly.
