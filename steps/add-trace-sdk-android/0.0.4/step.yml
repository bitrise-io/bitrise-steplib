  # Overview

  Ensures that Trace is added to a given Android application project. Adds the required
  dependency (trace-sdk) and applies the plugin (trace-gradle-plugin) if the project does not already have them.
  This step is needed, when you have not added Trace manually to your project. For manual
  installation see the documentation below.

  **Use this step before your application is built/assembled with Gradle**

      The path for the root project. By default it will be the source directory, but in some cases (for example if you
      have a monorepo) you may want to specify which directory should be used for this step.

      Step uses a Gradle task called "injectTrace" to add the required dependencies to the project. Also uses
      "verifyTrace" to verify Trace has been applied successfully to the project. For debugging
      purposes you may want to add additional flags to them, it would display useful information
      if you have any issue with the step.

      Examples: "--stactrace", "--info" or "--debug" (without the quote marks).

      Note: Multiple entries should be separated with a whitespace character.

      Example: "--stacktrace --info" (without the quote marks).
