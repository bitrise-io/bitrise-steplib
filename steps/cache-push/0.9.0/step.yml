    description: |-
      These paths will be ignored from change checking.
      If something changed under the specified path(s) and nothing else changed
      then the cache won't be updated.

      **These paths are NOT ignored from the cache**, if a path is located
      inside a specified Cache Path item it'll be included in the cache,
      just won't be checked for changes.

      Important: you can't ignore a path which results in an invalid cache item.
      For example, if you specify the path `a/path/to/cache` to be cached, you
      can't ignore `a/path/to`, as that would ignore every file from checking
      for a change - no fingerprint could be generated for `a/path/to/cache`.
      You're free to ignore paths inside a Cache Path however, e.g.
      if path is `a/path/to/cache` you're free to ignore `a/path/to/cache/.ignore-me`,
      unless that's the only file inside `a/path/to/cache`.

      The point is: you should not specify an ignore rule which would completely
      ignore a specified Cache Path item, as that would result in a path which
      can't be checked for updates/changes/fingerprints.
