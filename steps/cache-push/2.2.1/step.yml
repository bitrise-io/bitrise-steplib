title: Bitrise.io Cache:Push
summary: Updates the Cache, if required
description: |-
  This step checks whether the cache has to be updated (based on the
  `Cache Paths` and `Ignore Paths from change check` inputs).
  If it has to be updated, the step will create a new cache archive and upload it.

  It won't update/upload the cache if the cache did not change,
  nor in the case of Pull Request builds (unless you change the `run_if` property of the Step).

  For more information on setup and tips & tricks, check out our [Bitrise DevCenter guide](http://devcenter.bitrise.io/caching/about-caching/).

      Cache these paths. Separate paths with a newline.

      A path item can be either a file or a directory.

      You can also specify an "update indicator file" with the `->`
      syntax: `update/this -> if/this/file/is/updated`.
      *The indicator can only be a file!*

      If you have a path in the list which doesn't exist that will not cause
      this step to fail. It'll be logged but the step will try to gather
      as many specified & valid paths as it can, and just print a warning
      about the invalid items.

  opts:
    description: "These paths will be ignored from change checking.\nIf something
      has changed under the specified path(s) and nothing else has changed,\nthen
      the cache won't be updated.\n\n**Paths prefixed with an `!` will get ignored
      from the cache archive**.\nIf a path is located inside a specified Cache Path
      item and not prefixed with an `!`,\nit'll be included in the cache archive,
      but won't be checked for changes. \n\nThe path can also include `*`, `**`, `/`.\n`*`
      will replace a path element (for example, `a/*/b` will match `a/x/b`).\n`**`
      will replace part of a path (for example, `a/**/b` will match `a/x/y/z/b`).\nTo
      exclude a full directory like `/my/full/path`, simply put a `/` behind `/my/full/path`,\nso
      it will be `/my/full/path/`.\n\nImportant: you can't ignore a path which results
      in an invalid cache item.\nFor example, if you specify the path `a/path/to/cache`
      to be cached, you\ncan't ignore `a/path/to`, as that would ignore every file
      from checking\nfor a change and no fingerprint could be generated for `a/path/to/cache`.\nYou
      can ignore paths inside a Cache Path, however, if, for example, a path is `a/path/to/cache`,
      you can ignore `a/path/to/cache/.ignore-me`,\nunless that's the only file inside
      `a/path/to/cache`.\n\nThe point is: you should not specify an ignore rule which
      would completely\nignore a specified Cache Path item, as that would result in
      a path which\ncan't be checked for updates,changes or fingerprints."
    summary: Define the paths which have to be ignored when checking for cache changes.

- fingerprint_method: file-content-hash
  opts:
    description: |-
      The specified Fingerprint Method will be used to calculate
      fingerprints for the cached files.

      The (file) fingerprint is used to check whether
      the cached files did change - if it changed, a new cache will be generated.
      If the fingerprint matches the previous cache version's fingerprint, then
      no new cache will be generated.

      **Regardless of which method you choose** the following file attributes will
      be used to create the fingerprint **in addition** to the method you choose:

      * File path
      * File size
      * File permission bits

      Information about the options:

      * `file-content-hash` : create a file content checksum hash for every file in the cache,
        and use that as the fingerprint source of the file. This means that **the full file content will be loaded** in
        order to create the checksum hash!
      * `file-mod-time` : use the file's "modified at" time information. For larger files this method
        can be significantly faster, as the file doesn't have to be loaded to calculate this information!

      **Note**: in case of "update indicator files", the fingerprint method will always be `file-content-hash`,
      regardless of which option you select here.
