title: Bitrise.io Cache:Push
summary: Updates the Cache, if required
description: "Checks whether cache has to be updated based on the **Cache Paths**
  and **Ignore Paths** inputs.\nIf it does, the Step creates a new cache archive and
  uploads it. \nIt won't update/upload the cache if the cache hasn't changed nor in
  the case of a pull request unless you change the Step's `run_if` property. \nFor
  caching, you will need the **Bitrise.io Cache:Pull** Step at the beginning of your
  Workflow (after the **Git Clone Repository** Step but before a dependency installer
  Step) to download the previous cache, if any. \nThe **Bitrise.io Cache:Push** Step
  should be the very last Step in your Workflow.\n\n### Configuring the Step\n\n1.
  Cache any directory or file by adding it in the **Cache paths** field.\nFor most
  cases, caching will automatically work based on your native build and testing Steps
  as these automatically configure cache paths in your cache Steps.\nIf adding multiple
  paths, separate them with a newline.\nIf you have a path in the list which does
  not exist, it will not cause the Step to fail. \nYou can also specify an update
  indicator file with the `->` syntax, for example, `update/this -> if/this/file/is/updated.`
  \nPlease note the indicator points to a file and not to a folder.\n2. In the **Ignore
  Paths from change check** field, you can set any path which you don't want to do
  change analysis for.\n- Paths prefixed with an `!` will get ignored from the cache
  archive.\n- The path can also include `*`, `**`, `/`. \nThe `*` will replace a path
  element, the `**` will replace part of a path. \nTo exclude a full directory, simply
  put a `/` behind the directory.\nNote that you can't ignore a path which results
  in an invalid cache item.\n3. Modify **Working directory** if you wish to set relative
  cache paths and reference them from a working directory other than `$BITRISE_SOURCE_DIR`.\n4.
  Select a **Fingerprint Method** option (`file-content-hash` or `file-mod-time`)
  to detect changes in a directory, file, or in an update indicator file. \nIf changes
  are detected, new cache gets generated.\n5. If you set **Debug mode?** input to
  `true`, the Step will print out more detailed logs.\n6. With **Compress cache?**
  input set to `true`, you can compress the cache archive for faster uploads and downloads,
  especially useful for node-modules and other huge dependency folders.\n7. In `Ignore
  paths collected by steps` you can set which files or extensions should be ignored
  by the Step during the build.\n8. `Cache Upload URL` shows the URL where the cache
  gets uploaded.\n\n### Troubleshooting\nWe recommend you do not cache any dependency
  manager lock file (for example, `package.lock`, `gemfile.lock`, `podfile.lock`)
  as it would override the lock file in your repository.\n\n### Useful links\n- [About

      Cache these paths. Separate paths with a newline.

      A path item can be either a file or a directory.

      You can also specify an "update indicator file" with the `->`
      syntax: `update/this -> if/this/file/is/updated`.
      *The indicator can only be a file!*

      If you have a path in the list which doesn't exist that will not cause
      this step to fail. It'll be logged but the step will try to gather
      as many specified & valid paths as it can, and just print a warning
      about the invalid items.

    description: "These paths will be ignored from change checking.\nIf something
      has changed under the specified path(s) and nothing else has changed,\nthen
      the cache won't be updated.\n\n**Paths prefixed with an `!` will get ignored
      from the cache archive**.\nIf a path is located inside a specified Cache Path
      item and not prefixed with an `!`,\nit'll be included in the cache archive,
      but won't be checked for changes. \n\nThe path can also include `*`, `**`, `/`.\n`*`
      will replace a path element (for example, `a/*/b` will match `a/x/b`).\n`**`
      will replace part of a path (for example, `a/**/b` will match `a/x/y/z/b`).\nTo
      exclude a full directory like `/my/full/path`, simply put a `/` behind `/my/full/path`,\nso
      it will be `/my/full/path/`.\n\nImportant: you can't ignore a path which results
      in an invalid cache item.\nFor example, if you specify the path `a/path/to/cache`
      to be cached, you\ncan't ignore `a/path/to`, as that would ignore every file
      from checking\nfor a change and no fingerprint could be generated for `a/path/to/cache`.\nYou
      can ignore paths inside a Cache Path, however, if, for example, a path is `a/path/to/cache`,
      you can ignore `a/path/to/cache/.ignore-me`,\nunless that's the only file inside
      `a/path/to/cache`.\n\nThe point is: you should not specify an ignore rule which
      would completely\nignore a specified Cache Path item, as that would result in
      a path which\ncan't be checked for updates,changes or fingerprints."

- fingerprint_method: file-content-hash
  opts:
    description: |-
      The specified Fingerprint Method will be used to calculate
      fingerprints for the cached files.

      The (file) fingerprint is used to check whether
      the cached files did change - if it changed, a new cache will be generated.
      If the fingerprint matches the previous cache version's fingerprint, then
      no new cache will be generated.

      **Regardless of which method you choose** the following file attributes will
      be used to create the fingerprint **in addition** to the method you choose:

      * File path
      * File size
      * File permission bits

      Information about the options:

      * `file-content-hash` : create a file content checksum hash for every file in the cache,
        and use that as the fingerprint source of the file. This means that **the full file content will be loaded** in
        order to create the checksum hash!
      * `file-mod-time` : use the file's "modified at" time information. For larger files this method
        can be significantly faster, as the file doesn't have to be loaded to calculate this information!

      **Note**: in case of "update indicator files", the fingerprint method will always be `file-content-hash`,
      regardless of which option you select here.
