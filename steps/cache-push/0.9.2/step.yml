title: Bitrise.io Cache:Push [BETA]
summary: Updates the Cache, if required
description: |-
  This Step checks whether the Cache have to be updated (based on the
  `Cache Paths` and `Ignore Paths from change check` inputs),
  and if it have to be it will create a new cache archive and upload it.

  It won't update/upload the Cache if the Cache did not change,
  nor in case of Pull Request builds (unless you change the `run_if` property of the Step).

  You can find a setup and tips & tricks guide on the Bitrise DevCenter
  at [http://devcenter.bitrise.io/docs/using-the-build-cache](http://devcenter.bitrise.io/docs/using-the-build-cache).

      Cache these paths. Separate paths with a newline.

      A path item can be either a file or a directory.

      You can also specify an "update indicator file" with the `->`
      syntax: `update/this -> if/this/file/is/updated`.
      *The indicator can only be a file!*

      If you have a path in the list which doesn't exist that will not cause
      this Step to fail. It'll be logged but the Step will try to gather
      as many specified & valid paths as it can, and just print warning
      about the invalid items.

      These paths will be ignored from change checking.
      If something changed under the specified path(s) and nothing else changed
      then the cache won't be updated.

      **These paths are NOT ignored from the cache**, if a path is located
      inside a specified Cache Path item it'll be included in the cache,
      just won't be checked for changes.

      The path can also include the `*` wildcard character, which will
      do a **string** based compare (e.g. `a/*/b` will match `a/1/2/3/b` too,
      not just `a/x/b`).

      Important: you can't ignore a path which results in an invalid cache item.
      For example, if you specify the path `a/path/to/cache` to be cached, you
      can't ignore `a/path/to`, as that would ignore every file from checking
      for a change - no fingerprint could be generated for `a/path/to/cache`.
      You're free to ignore paths inside a Cache Path however, e.g.
      if path is `a/path/to/cache` you're free to ignore `a/path/to/cache/.ignore-me`,
      unless that's the only file inside `a/path/to/cache`.

      The point is: you should not specify an ignore rule which would completely
      ignore a specified Cache Path item, as that would result in a path which
      can't be checked for updates/changes/fingerprints.

      The specified Fingerprint Method will be used to calculate
      fingerprints for the cached files.

      The (file) fingerprint is used to check whether
      the cached files did change - if it changed a new cache will be generated,
      if the fingerprint matches the previous cache version's fingerprint then
      no new cache will be generated.

      **Regardless of which method you choose** the following file attributes will
      be used to create the fingerprint **in addition** to the method you choose:

      * File path
      * File size
      * File permission bits

      Information about the options:

      * `file-content-hash` : create a file content checksum hash for every file in the cache,
        and use that as the fingerprint source of the file. This means that **the full file content will be loaded** in
        order to create the checksum hash!
      * `file-mod-time` : use the file's "modified at" time information. For larger files this method
        can be significantly faster, as the file don't have to be loaded to calculate this information!

      **Note**: in case of "update indicator files" the fingerprint method will always be `file-content-hash`,
      regardless of which option you select here.
