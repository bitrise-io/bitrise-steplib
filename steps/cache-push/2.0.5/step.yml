title: Bitrise.io Cache:Push
summary: Updates the Cache, if required
description: |-
  This Step checks whether the Cache have to be updated (based on the
  `Cache Paths` and `Ignore Paths from change check` inputs),
  and if it have to be it will create a new cache archive and upload it.

  It won't update/upload the Cache if the Cache did not change,
  nor in case of Pull Request builds (unless you change the `run_if` property of the Step).

  You can find a setup and tips & tricks guide on the Bitrise DevCenter
  at [http://devcenter.bitrise.io/caching/about-caching/](http://devcenter.bitrise.io/caching/about-caching/).

      Cache these paths. Separate paths with a newline.

      A path item can be either a file or a directory.

      You can also specify an "update indicator file" with the `->`
      syntax: `update/this -> if/this/file/is/updated`.
      *The indicator can only be a file!*

      If you have a path in the list which doesn't exist that will not cause
      this Step to fail. It'll be logged but the Step will try to gather
      as many specified & valid paths as it can, and just print warning
      about the invalid items.

    description: "These paths will be ignored from change checking.\nIf something
      changed under the specified path(s) and nothing else changed\nthen the cache
      won't be updated.\n\n**Paths are not prefixed with `!` will NOT ignored from
      the cache archive**,\nif a path is located inside a specified Cache Path item
      and not prefixed with `!`,\nit'll be included in the cache archive, just won't
      be checked for changes. \n\nThe path can also include `*`, `**`, `/`.\n`*` will
      do path element replace (e.g. `a/*/b` will match `a/x/b`).\n`**` will do path
      part replace (e.g. `a/**/b` will match `a/x/y/z/b`).\nTo exclude full directory
      like: `/my/full/path`, just simply put a `/` behind of it,\nso it will be `/my/full/path/`.\n\nImportant:
      you can't ignore a path which results in an invalid cache item.\nFor example,
      if you specify the path `a/path/to/cache` to be cached, you\ncan't ignore `a/path/to`,
      as that would ignore every file from checking\nfor a change - no fingerprint
      could be generated for `a/path/to/cache`.\nYou're free to ignore paths inside
      a Cache Path however, e.g.\nif path is `a/path/to/cache` you're free to ignore
      `a/path/to/cache/.ignore-me`,\nunless that's the only file inside `a/path/to/cache`.\n\nThe
      point is: you should not specify an ignore rule which would completely\nignore
      a specified Cache Path item, as that would result in a path which\ncan't be
      checked for updates/changes/fingerprints."

  opts:
    description: |-
      The specified Fingerprint Method will be used to calculate
      fingerprints for the cached files.

      The (file) fingerprint is used to check whether
      the cached files did change - if it changed a new cache will be generated,
      if the fingerprint matches the previous cache version's fingerprint then
      no new cache will be generated.

      **Regardless of which method you choose** the following file attributes will
      be used to create the fingerprint **in addition** to the method you choose:

      * File path
      * File size
      * File permission bits

      Information about the options:

      * `file-content-hash` : create a file content checksum hash for every file in the cache,
        and use that as the fingerprint source of the file. This means that **the full file content will be loaded** in
        order to create the checksum hash!
      * `file-mod-time` : use the file's "modified at" time information. For larger files this method
        can be significantly faster, as the file don't have to be loaded to calculate this information!

      **Note**: in case of "update indicator files" the fingerprint method will always be `file-content-hash`,
      regardless of which option you select here.
