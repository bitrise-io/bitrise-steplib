title: Device Farmer/Open STF Connect
summary: |
  Connects with devices from Device Farmer/Open Smartphone Test Farm
description: |
  To use this step, you need an access to running [Device Farmer](https://devicefarmer.github.io/) or [Open STF](https://openstf.io/) instance with at least 1 device connected.
  [Access token](https://github.com/devicefarmer/stf/blob/master/doc/API.md#authentication) and ADB keys has to be set up using STF web UI.
  Typical workflow:

  1. App compilation e.g. using Gradle Runner step.

  2. Device Farmer/Open STF Connect (this step).

  3. Android instrumention and/or UI tests e.g. using Gradle Unit Test step.

  4. Device Farmer/Open STF Disconnect step with `is_always_run: true` (to stop using remote devices).

      If not empty will be passed to `jq` as a select expression. Syntax details can be found in [jq manual](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/#select(boolean_expression)).
      Non-matching devices will be filtered out. Note that `.present and .owner == null` filter is applied implicitly so you don't need to add it manually.

    summary: Optional device requirements e.g. API level or manufacturer declared
      as jq select expression. For example to use only devices with API level 21 or
      newer `.sdk >= "21"`. Only present and not used devices are taken into account.

- device_number_limit: null
  opts:

      Maximum number of devices to be used. 0 and empty mean unlimited.
      If there are more available devices (after applying filter if any), only amount up to this number will be used. Devices will be chosen randomly.

      Key used during build has to be registered in STF under `Settings->Keys->ADB Keys`.
      You have to either provide value here or modify `~/.android/adbkey` before this step.
      Otherwise devices will be listed as unauthorized and cannot be used during build.
