title: Export iOS and tvOS Xcode archive
summary: Export iOS and tvOS IPA from an existing Xcode archive
description: |-
  Exports an IPA from an existing iOS and tvOS `.xcarchive` file. You can add multiple **Export iOS and tvOS Xcode archive** Steps to your Workflows to create multiple different signed .ipa files.
  The Step also logs you into your Apple Developer account based on the [Apple service connection you provide on Bitrise](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/en/accounts/connecting-to-services/apple-services-connection.html) and downloads any provisioning profiles needed for your project based on the **Distribution method**.

  ### Configuring the Step
  Before you start:
  - Make sure you have connected your [Apple Service account to Bitrise](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/en/accounts/connecting-to-services/apple-services-connection.html).
  Alternatively, you can upload certificates and profiles to Bitrise manually, then use the Certificate and Profile installer step before Xcode Archive
  - Make sure certificates are uploaded to Bitrise's **Code Signing** tab. The right provisioning profiles are automatically downloaded from Apple as part of the automatic code signing process.

  To configure the Step:
  1. **Archive Path**: Specifies the archive that should be exported. The input value sets xcodebuild's `-archivePath` option.
  2. **Select a product to distribute**: Decide if an App or an App Clip IPA should be exported.
  3. **Distribution method**: Describes how Xcode should export the archive: development, app-store, ad-hoc, or enterprise.

  Under **Automatic code signing**:
  1. **Automatic code signing method**: Select the Apple service connection you want to use for code signing. Available options: `off` if you don't do automatic code signing, `api-key` [if you use API key authorization](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/en/accounts/connecting-to-services/connecting-to-an-apple-service-with-api-key.html), and `apple-id` [if you use Apple ID authorization](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/en/accounts/connecting-to-services/connecting-to-an-apple-service-with-apple-id.html).
  2. **Register test devices on the Apple Developer Portal**: If this input is set, the Step will register the known test devices on Bitrise from team members with the Apple Developer Portal. Note that setting this to `yes` may cause devices to be registered against your limited quantity of test devices in the Apple Developer Portal, which can only be removed once annually during your renewal window.
  3. **The minimum days the Provisioning Profile should be valid**: If this input is set to >0, the managed Provisioning Profile will be renewed if it expires within the configured number of days. Otherwise the Step renews the managed Provisioning Profile if it is expired.
  4. The **Code signing certificate URL**, the **Code signing certificate passphrase**, the **Keychain path**, and the **Keychain password** inputs are automatically populated if certificates are uploaded to Bitrise's **Code Signing** tab. If you store your files in a private repo, you can manually edit these fields.

  Under **IPA export configuration**:
  1. **Developer Portal team**: Add the Developer Portal team's name to use for this export. This input defaults to the team used to build the archive.
  2. **Rebuild from bitcode**: For non-App Store exports, should Xcode re-compile the app from bitcode?
  3. **Include bitcode**: For App Store exports, should the package include bitcode?
  4. **iCloud container environment**: If the app is using CloudKit, this input configures the `com.apple.developer.icloud-container-environment` entitlement. Available options vary depending on the type of provisioning profile used, but may include: `Development` and `Production`.
  5. **Export options plist content**: Specifies a `plist` file content that configures archive exporting. If not specified, the Step will auto-generate it.

  Under Debugging:
  1. **Verbose logging***: You can set this input to `yes` to produce more informative logs.
