  Step moves Jira tasks from given initial state to target state if their ids are in git log
description: |
  Step searches Jira project for tasks that are in `from_status` (e.g. `Deploying`) state
  and after successful build moves them to `to_status` (e.g. `Stabilization on QA`) state.

  This is useful if you use smart commits in Jira, e.g. if your commit message
  includes `TEST-123 #Do`.
  This would cause the issue TEST-123 to transition according to `Do` keyword.

  The step works for multiple issues mentioned in last 100 commits, so if
  you finished multiple tasks it should move all of them to the `to_status` state
  provided they are in `from_status` at the moment of execution.

  The step can also add custom value to the custom field in the Jira issue e.g. version of the app.
