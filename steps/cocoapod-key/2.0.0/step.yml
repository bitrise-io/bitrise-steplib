      Previously, this was used to run `pod keys set $KEY $VALUE`, but, on a CI environment, it is better if this is store in the SECRETS of the application.
      Cocoapod-keys can fetch values from the environment. So, if you have a key named `MyKey`, you just need to create a secret with the same name: `MeyKey = Value`.
      This is safer since the value never leaves Bitrise secrets, and avoids having it leaked on logs.

      This variable is still listed in the step to avoid that someone that upgrades looses its info. But, it is no longer used.
