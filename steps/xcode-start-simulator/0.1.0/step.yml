      The input value uses the same format as xcodebuild's `-destination` option.

      When larger than 0, will wait for the simulator boot to complete.

      Setting to larger than 0 makes it possible to detect hangs or timeouts when booting simulator.
      If a timeout occurs, the `BITRISE_SIMULATOR_STATUS` output will be set to `hanged`.
      A reccomended value is 90.

      Using `0` (the default) enables the Simulator boot to occur in parallel to other Steps.

      If enabled, will shutdown and erase a simulator's contents and settings.

      This option is not needed when starting from a clean state on a CI build.
      It may be used when running testing multiple apps on the same simulator or for making sure that the simulator is indeed in a clean state when an app fails to install due to an unexpected issue.

      When enabled erasing contents takes about a second.

      Possible values are:
      - `booted`
      - `failed`
      - `hanged`

      It can be used to trigger a new build conditionally:

      ```
      is_always_run: true
      run_if: '{{enveq "BITRISE_SIMULATOR_STATUS" "hanged"}}'
