title: Mobile apps sizes monitoring
summary: |
  Check and monitor mobile applications sizes
description: |
  Check mobile applications sizes and compare with configured values to be warned when apps sizes increased

  ### Usage


  To give to our step the information about the expected values, you have:
  - create a config file (which should be added to your project repository) and set `config_file_path`  to find them. You can find a config example file [here](https://github.com/odemolliens/bitrise-step-monitoring-apps-sizes#config-file-example)
  - **OR** set these keys with expected values directly on Bitrise side
    - android_apk_size
    - ios_ipa_size
    - alert_threshold

  ### Troubleshooting

  - Be aware, you have to launch this step after [apps-decompiler](https://github.com/imranMnts/bitrise-step-apps-decompiler) step
