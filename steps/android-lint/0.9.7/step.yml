title: Android Lint
summary: Runs Lint on your Android project source files and detects potential syntax
  errors to keep your code error free.
description: |-
  It highlights the code line where the error is found, explains the type of error and suggests corrections. The Step does not make the build fail if it spots any structural errors in your code. If you have inserted the **Deploy to Bitrise.io** Step in the Workflow, the tes results will be available in a viewable or downloadable Lint Report HTML or XML file which you can access on the Build's APPS & ARTIFACTS page.

  ### Configuring the Step

  1. Set the **Project Location** input which, by default, points to the root directory of your Android project.
  2. Set the module and variant you wish to lint in the **Module** and **Variant** fields.

  Optionally, you can modify these inputs:
  1. You can specify where the Lint reports should be found once the Step has run if you overwrite the **Report location pattern** input.
  2. You can set if the Step should cache build outputs and dependencies, only the dependencies or nothing at all in the **Set level of cache** input.
  3. You can set any gradle argument to the gradle task in the **Additional Gradle Arguments** input.

  ### Troubleshooting
  Make sure you insert the Step before a build Step.
  Make sure you type the correct module and variant names in the respective fields of the Step. If you are unsure about the exact names, you can check them in the **Project Structure** dialog of your project in Android Studio.
