title: Add Trace SDK
summary: Add the Trace SDK during the Xcode build process.
description: "Adds the Trace SDK static library during the Xcode build process into
  the resulting app artifact.\n\niOS:\n  The step works by linking and modifying the
  relevant Xcode project descriptor files to include necessary configurations in `other
  linker flags`. These are the following:\n    - Trace static library path\n    -
  System libraries: `C` and `C++` \n    - System Framework `SystemConfiguration.framework`\n
  \ \n  System libraries and frameworks are linked if they are not present. Itâ€™s recommended
  to add this step just before the Xcode build and archive step. \n  This step is
  compatible with all Xcode projects that use Swift only, interoperability (mixed)
  and Objective-C only languages. \n\n  Source code for the iOS SDK can be found here:
  https://github.com/bitrise-io/trace-cocoa-sdk\n\n  Supported stack: Xcode 11 and
  12\n\nAndroid:\n  TBA.\n  \nOnce the app has been deployed, developers can view
  the results of the app in the Trace addon.\n\nTrace: https://trace.bitrise.io\nWhat's
