title: Google Play Deploy
summary: Upload your Android app to Google Play.
description: "The Step uploads your Android app to Google Play. It works with both
  APK and AAB files.\n\nPlease note that in order to successfully use this Step, you
  must [upload your first APK or AAB file manually](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9859152?hl=en&visit_id=637407764704794872-3953166533&rd=1),
  using Google's own web interface! \nOnce you uploaded one APK or AAB of your app
  to Google Play manually, you can use our Step for all subsequent versions. \n\n###
  Configuring the Step\n\nThe Step uses Google's API so before attempting to use the
  Step, you need to [Set up Google API access](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/deploy/android-deploy/deploying-android-apps/#setting-up-google-play-api-access).
  This includes:\n- [Linking your Google Developer Console to an API project](https://developers.google.com/android-publisher/getting_started#linking_your_api_project).\n-
  [Setting up API access using a service account](https://developers.google.com/android-publisher/getting_started#using_a_service_account).\n-
  Granting the necessary access rights to the service account. \n- Upload the service
  account JSON key to Bitrise and store it in a [Secret Env Var](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/builds/env-vars-secret-env-vars/).
  \n\nDue to the way the Google Play Publisher API works, you have to grant at least
  the following permissions to that service account:\n- Edit store listing, pricing
  & distribution\n- Manage Production APKs\n- Manage Alpha & Beta APKs\n- Manage Alpha
  & Beta users\n\nRead the full process in our [Deploying Android apps guide](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/deploy/android-deploy/deploying-android-apps/).\n\nTo
  deploy your app with the Step:\n\n1. In the **Service Account JSON key file path**,
  add the Secret that stores your service account JSON key. \n1. In the **App file
  path** input, set the path to your APK and/or AAB files. You can add multiple paths
  here, separated with a newline. \n   In most cases, the default values work well
  unless you changed the output variable of the Step that build your APK or AAB.\n1.
  In the **Package name**  input, set the package name of your app.  \n1. In the **Track**
  input, add the track to which you want to assign the app. This can be any of the
  built-in tracks or a custom track of your own.\n\n### Troubleshooting \n\nIf the
  Step fails, check the following:\n- If it's an authentication error, check that
  your Secret points to the correct file (and that a file is uploaded at all). \n-
  Make sure your service account has the necessary access rights.\n- Check that there's
  no typo in the package name and that you selected an existing track for the app.
