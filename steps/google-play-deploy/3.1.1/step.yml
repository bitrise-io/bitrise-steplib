  Uploads and releases apps to Google Play Store.

  The step supports single APK, [multiple APK](https://developer.android.com/google/play/publishing/multiple-apks.html) and Bundle deploys.

  To use this step:

  1. Upload the first apk manually (using the web interface):

    Visit the [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/apps/publish) -> All applications -> CREATE APPLICATION

  2. Link your Google Play Developer Console to an API project:

    Described in [Google Play Developer API](https://developers.google.com/android-publisher/getting_started)'s __Linking your API Project__ section

  3. Setup API Access Clients, using a service account:

    Described in [Google Play Developer API](https://developers.google.com/android-publisher/getting_started)'s __Using a service account__ section

    __NOTE__: When you create your service account on the Google Play Developer Console, choose json as `Key Type`.

  4. Grant the necessary rights to the service account:

    Visit the [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/apps/publish) -> Settings -> Users & permissions -> Invite new user.

    Due to the way the Google Play Publisher API works, you have to grant at least the following permissions to that service account:

      - ACCESS LEVEL: View app information
      - RELEASE MANAGEMENT: Manage production releases, Manage testing track releases
      - STORE PRESENCE: Edit store listing, pricing & distribution

  5. OPTIONAL - Add translations for your Store Listing:

    To allow the step to assign your 'whatsnew' files to the uploaded apk version.
