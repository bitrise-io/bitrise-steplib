summary: Google Play Deploy

  To use this step:

  1. You have to upload the first apk manually (using the web interface).
    See: https://play.google.com/apps/publish -> All applications -> Add new application

  2. You must link your Google Play Developer Console to an API project.
    See: https://developers.google.com/android-publisher/getting_started. Check the __Linking your API Project section__.

  3. Setting Up API Access Clients, using a service account:
    See: https://developers.google.com/android-publisher/getting_started. Check the __Using a service account__ section.
    When you create your service account on the google developer console, choose json as `Key Type`.

  4. Grant Access to provide the service account the necessary rights.
    See: https://play.google.com/apps/publish -> Settings -> User account & rights -> Invite new user and give the privileges.
    Due to the way the Google Play Publisher API works, you have to grant at least the following permissions to that service account:
     - Edit store listing, pricing & distribution
     - Manage Production APKs
     - Manage Alpha & Beta APKs
     - Manage Alpha & Beta users

  5. OPTIONAL - Add translations for your Store Listing.
    To allow the step to assign your 'whatsnew' files to the uploaded apk version.
    See: https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/3125566?hl=en (Add translations for your Store Listing)
