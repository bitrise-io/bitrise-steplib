title: Generate Text File
summary: |
  Dynamically generate a text file
description: |
  This step lets you generate a dynamic text file which can use any environment
  variables. The path of the file will be made available as
  `$GENERATED_TEXT_FILE_PATH`. This script can e.g. be used to generate the Play
  Store's "What's New" file based on the Git commit message.
