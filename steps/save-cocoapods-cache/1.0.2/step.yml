  Caches dependencies in the Pods folder. This Step needs to be used in combination with **Restore Cocoapods Cache**.

  This Step is based on [key-based caching](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/en/builds/caching/key-based-caching.html) and sets up the cache key and path automatically for Cocoapods dependencies. If you'd like to change the cache key (or paths to cache), you might want to use the generic [Save cache](https://github.com/bitrise-steplib/bitrise-step-save-cache) Step instead.
