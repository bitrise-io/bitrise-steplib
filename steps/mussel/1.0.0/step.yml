title: Mussel
summary: A framework for easily testing Push Notifications, Universal Links and Routing
  in XCUITests.
description: "As of Xcode 14.4, users are able to test Push Notifications via the
  simulator. \nUnfortunately, Apple has yet to introduce the ability to leverage this
  new method within the XCUITest Framework.\n\nTesting Universal Links can also be
  an adventure, potentially accumulating lots of extra unwanted time in UI Tests,
  especially if your team wants to speed up your app's regression progress. \nConventional
  methods resorted to using iMessage or Contacts to open Universal Links which routed
  to a specific feature within an application.\n\nMussel introduces a quick and simple
  way to test Push Notifications and Universal Links which route to any specific features
  within your iOS app.\n\nHow It Works:\n  1. An Engineer triggers XCUITests in XCode
  manually or through your Continuous Integration platform of choice.\n  2. Mussel
  Server boots up along with the iOS Simulator.\n  3. A Test Case triggers a Push
  Notification or Universal Link Test Case\n  4. The Test Case sends a payload containing
  Push Notification or Universal Link data via POST Request.\n  5. Server runs respective
  xcrun simctl command for Push Notifications or Universal Links.\n  6. The command
  presents a Push Notification or launches a Universal Link within the iOS Simulator."
