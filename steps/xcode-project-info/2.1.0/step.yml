summary: Extracts Xcode project info data to environment variables.
description: |-
  This step will simply extract Xcode project information (Version and Build),
  and export them into environment variables prefixed with **XPI_**.

  Afterwards, you can use these environment variables in other steps (ie. sending message on Slack).

        Source directory is considered to be root directory created by the Git Clone step.
        If your `Info.plist` file is in **RootDir/ProjectName** directory (for example), 
        then you should set this input to `ProjectName/Info.plist`.

        Required for Xcode 11+, since version & build numbers are no longer stored in Info.plist, but replaced by the variables $(MARKETING_VERSION) and $(CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION).
        The actual numbers should be extracted from the pbxproj file.
