  Upload iOS debug symbols to Instabug through Bitrise CI.

  ### Configuring the Step
  1. Add the **Instabug iOS Symbol Upload** Step to your Workflow after any build Step.
  2. Set the **Working directory**.
  3. Set the **Instabug App Token**. It's highly recommended to have this value in an env var and reference that.

  ### Troubleshooting
  Make sure you insert the Step after any build Step so that every dependency and env var is already setted.
