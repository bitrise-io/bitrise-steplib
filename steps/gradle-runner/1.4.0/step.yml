      Gradle task to run.

      You can call `gradle tasks` or `gradle tasks --all` in your
      Gradle project directory to get the list of available tasks.

      Using a Gradle Wrapper (gradlew) is required, as the wrapper is what makes sure
      that the right Gradle version is installed and used for the build.

      __You can find more information about the Gradle Wrapper (gradlew),
      and about how you can generate one (if you would not have one already)__
      in the official guide at: [https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html).

      **The path should be relative** to the repository root / `workdir`, for example: `./gradlew`.

- apk_file_include_filter: '*.apk'
  opts:
    description: |
      The step will move the generated apk files that match this filter
      into the Bitrise Deploy Directory.

      This filter is a standerd bash find commands -name pattern, see: http://linux.die.net/man/1/find

      Example: `*release*.apk`
    title: APK file include filter
- apk_file_exclude_filter: '*-unaligned.apk'
  opts:
    description: |
      The step will **not** move the generated apk files that match this filter
      into the Bitrise Deploy Directory.

      You can use this step to avoid moving unalinged or unsigned apk files.

      This filter is a standerd bash find commands negated -name pattern, see: http://linux.die.net/man/1/find

      Example: `*unaligned*.apk`
    title: APK file exclude filter
- mapping_file_include_filter: '*/mapping.txt'
  opts:
    description: |
      The step will move the generated mapping files that match this filter
      into the Bitrise Deploy Directory.

      This filter is a standerd bash find commands -path pattern, see: http://linux.die.net/man/1/find

      Example: `*/release/mapping.txt`
    title: Mapping file include filter
- mapping_file_exclude_filter: null

      The step will **not** move the generated mapping files that match this filter
      into the Bitrise Deploy Directory.

      You can use this step to avoid moving beta mapping file.

      This filter is a standerd bash find commands negated -path pattern, see: http://linux.die.net/man/1/find

      Example: `*/beta/mapping.txt`

  opts:

      This output will include the path of the generated APK,
      after filtering based on the filter inputs.

      If the build generates more than one APK which fulfills the
      filter inputs this output will contain the last one's path.

- BITRISE_MAPPING_PATH: ""
  opts:

      This output will include the path of the generated mapping.txt.

      If more than one mapping.txt exist in project this output will contain the last one's path.
