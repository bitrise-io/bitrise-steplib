      Gradle task to run.

      You can call `gradle tasks` or `gradle tasks --all` in your
      Gradle project directory to get the list of available tasks.

      Using a Gradle Wrapper (gradlew) is required, as the wrapper is what makes sure
      that the right Gradle version is installed and used for the build.

      __You can find more information about the Gradle Wrapper (gradlew),
      and about how you can generate one (if you would not have one already)__
      in the official guide at: [https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html).

      **The path should be relative** to the repository root, for example: `./gradlew`,
      or if it's in a sub directory: `./sub/dir/gradlew`.

      The step will copy the generated apk files that match this filter into the Bitrise Deploy Directory.

      This filter is a standard find commands -path pattern, see: http://linux.die.net/man/1/find

      If you specify an empty filter, the step will set this filter to: `*.apk`.

      Example:

      - `*release*.apk` - Copy every apk which filename contains `release`, like (`./app/build/outputs/apk/app-release-unsigned.apk`).

- apk_file_exclude_filter: '*-unaligned.apk'
  opts:
    category: Export Config

      The step will **not** copy the generated apk files that match this filter into the Bitrise Deploy Directory.
      You can use this filter to avoid moving unalinged or unsigned apk files.

      This filter is a standard find commands negated -path flag, see: http://linux.die.net/man/1/find

      If you specify an empty filter, every apk file (selected by `apk_file_include_filter`) will be copied.

      Example:

      - `*unaligned*.apk` - Avoid to copy apk if filename contains `unaligned`.

      The step will copy the generated mapping files that match this filter into the Bitrise Deploy Directory.

      This filter is a standard find commands -path pattern, see: http://linux.die.net/man/1/find

      If you specify an empty filter, no mapping files will be copied.

      Example: `*mapping.txt` - Copy every mapping.txt file.

      The step will **not** copy the generated mapping files that match this filter into the Bitrise Deploy Directory.
      You can use this step to avoid moving beta mapping file.

      This filter is a standard find commands negated -path flag, see: http://linux.die.net/man/1/find

      If you specify an empty filter, every mapping files (selected by `mapping_file_include_filter`) will be copied.

      Example: `*/beta/mapping.txt` - Avoid to copy mapping.txt file in a `beta` directoy.
