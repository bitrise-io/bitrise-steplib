      You can call `gradle tasks` or `gradle tasks --all` in your
      Gradle project directory to get the list of available tasks.

      Using a Gradle Wrapper (gradlew) is required, as the wrapper ensures
      that the right Gradle version is installed and used for the build.

      You can find more information about the Gradle Wrapper (gradlew),
      and about how you can generate one
      in the official guide at: [https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html).

      **The path should be relative** to the repository root. For example, `./gradlew`,
      or if it is in a sub directory, `./sub/dir/gradlew`.

      The step will copy the generated APK files that match this filter into the Bitrise Deploy Directory.

      This filter is a standard find commands -path pattern, see: http://linux.die.net/man/1/find

      If you specify an empty filter, the step will set this filter to: `*.apk`.

      Example:

      Copy every APK file:

      ```
      "*.apk"
      ```

      Copy every APK file with a filename that contains `release`, like (`./app/build/outputs/apk/app-release-unsigned.apk`):

      ```
      *release*.apk
      ```

      One filter per line. The step will **not** copy the generated APK files that match this filters into the Bitrise Deploy Directory.
      You can use this filter to avoid moving unalinged and/or unsigned apk files.

      This filter is a standard find commands negated -path flag, see: http://linux.die.net/man/1/find

      If you specify an empty filter, every APK file (selected by `apk_file_include_filter`) will be copied.

      Examples:

      Do not copy APK files with a filename that contains `unaligned`:

      ```
      *unaligned*.apk
      ```

      Do not copy APK files with a filename that contains `unaligned` and/or `Test`:

      ```
      *unaligned*.apk
      *Test*.apk
