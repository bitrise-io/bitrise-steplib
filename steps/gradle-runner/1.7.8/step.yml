      Gradle project directory to get the list of available tasks.

      Using a Gradle Wrapper (gradlew) is required, as the wrapper is what makes sure
      that the right Gradle version is installed and used for the build.

      __You can find more information about the Gradle Wrapper (gradlew),
      and about how you can generate one (if you would not have one already)__
      in the official guide at: [https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html).

      **The path should be relative** to the repository root, for example: `./gradlew`,
      or if it's in a sub directory: `./sub/dir/gradlew`.

      The step will copy the generated apk files that match this filter into the Bitrise Deploy Directory.

      This filter is a standard find commands -path pattern, see: http://linux.die.net/man/1/find

      If you specify an empty filter, the step will set this filter to: `*.apk`.

      Example:

      Copy every apk:

      ```
      "*.apk"
      ```

      Copy every apk which filename contains `release`, like (`./app/build/outputs/apk/app-release-unsigned.apk`):

      ```
      *release*.apk

      You can use this filter to avoid moving unalinged and/or unsigned apk files.

      This filter is a standard find commands negated -path flag, see: http://linux.die.net/man/1/find

      If you specify an empty filter, every apk file (selected by `apk_file_include_filter`) will be copied.

      Examples:

      Avoid to copy apk if filename contains `unaligned`:

      *unaligned*.apk
      ```

      Avoid to copy apk if filename contains `unaligned` and/or `Test`:
