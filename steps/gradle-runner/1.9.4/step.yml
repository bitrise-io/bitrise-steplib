      Gradle project directory to get the list of available tasks.

      Using a Gradle Wrapper (gradlew) is required, as the wrapper ensures
      that the right Gradle version is installed and used for the build.

      You can find more information about the Gradle Wrapper (gradlew),
      and about how you can generate one
      in the official guide at: [https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html).

      **The path should be relative** to the repository root. For example, `./gradlew`,
      or if it is in a sub directory, `./sub/dir/gradlew`.

      *.apk

      Copy every APK file with a filename that contains `release`, like (`./app/build/outputs/apk/app-release-unsigned.apk`):

      One filter per line. The step will **not** copy the generated APK and AAB files that match this filters into the Bitrise Deploy Directory.
      You can use this filter to avoid moving unalinged and/or unsigned APK and AAB files.

      If you specify an empty filter, every APK and AAB file (selected by `APK and AAB file include filter`) will be copied.

      Seperate patterns with a newline.

      Examples:

      Do not copy APK files with a filename that contains `unaligned`:

      ```
      *unaligned*.apk

      Do not copy APK files with a filename that contains `unaligned` and/or `Test`:
