      **Optional**

      If specified the `gradle` commands will be
      executed with this `gradlew` file, instead of with `gradle` directly;
      for example: `./gradlew assemble` instead of `gradle assemble`.

      **The path should be relative** to the repository root / `workdir`,
      for example: `./gradlew`.

      The step will **not** moves generated apk files that match with this filter
      into the Bitrise Deploy Directory.

      You can use this step to avoid moving unalinged or unsigned apk files.

      This output will include the path of the generated APK,
      after filtering based on the filter inputs.

      If the build generates more than one APK which fulfills the
      filter inputs this output will contain the last one's path.
