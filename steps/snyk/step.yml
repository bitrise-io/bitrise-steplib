  Bitrise Snyk Step incorporates Snyk into your Bitrise workflows.
  By utilizing this step, you will be able to test your project dependencies for vulnerabilities during builds and use Snyk to monitor your projects
  for new vulnerabilities.
  This step uses Snyk as an external service and requires your authentication token.
