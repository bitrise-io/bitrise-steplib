  This Step git clones the selected branch or tag of the official Flutter repository and runs the initial setup of the Flutter SDK.
  Use this step *before* the cache-pull step to make sure caching works correctly.

  ### Configuring the Step
  1. In the **Flutter SDK git repository version** input set the tag or branch of the Flutter. The default value is `stable` which clones and installs the latest stable Flutter branch.
  2. In the **Update to the latest version** input select `false` to use a preinstalled Flutter version or `true` to update Flutter SDK to the latest version released in the [build release channel](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Flutter-build-release-channels). By default, this input is set to `true`.
  4. Enable **Print debug information** to run `flutter doctor` to see if there are any missing platform dependencies for setting up Flutter.

  ### Troubleshooting
  If you prefer to install Flutter from an installation bundle instead of the git repository, use the **Flutter SDK installation bundle URL** input. Insert the URL of the preferred [bundle](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/sdk/releases), for example, `https://storage.googleapis.com/flutter_infra/releases/dev/windows/flutter_windows_v1.14.5-dev.zip`. If the input is filled out correctly, it overrides the value set in the **Flutter SDK git repository version** input.

      Use this input to install from the git repository by specifying a tag or branch.

      Use this input for the stable channel, as the stable channel can be preinstalled.

      If the input Flutter SDK installation bundle URL is specified, this input is ignored.

      Installation bundle URL. If specified, Flutter will be installed from here and git repository version is ignored.

      For a channel other than stable (e.g. beta), it is recommended to use this input. It is faster than cloning from git.

      Official list of Flutter installation bundles: [https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/sdk/releases](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/sdk/releases)

      The URL is expected to begin with: `https://storage.googleapis.com/flutter_infra`
