summary: |
  Run scripts from a file
description: |
  The Step runs a script from a file using a specified executor. It provides great flexibility and lets you run any file written in any scripting language, such as Bash, Ruby, PHP, Python, etc.

  ### Configuring the Step

  1. Choose a script to run by specifying its location and name in the **Script location** input. For example, if you have a `script.py` in your root directory, you could put in: `$BITRISE_SOURCE_DIR/script.py`.
  1. Specify which executor to use for the script in the **Execute with / runner binary** input.
  1. (Optional) Under the **Debug** tab, you can specify a working directory for the script in the **Working directory** input and enable debug logging in the **Debug print?** input.

      The executor to be used for running the script.
      You can use any binary which is in the PATH (bash/ruby/etc.),
      multipart commands (e. g. go run), absolute paths (e. g. /bin/sh)
      or binaries from env (e. g. /usr/bin/env python). You can
      specify flags as well (e. g. /bin/bash -l).

      This directory will be set as the current working
      directory for the script.
      Any relative path in the script (file_path) will be
      relative to this directory.
