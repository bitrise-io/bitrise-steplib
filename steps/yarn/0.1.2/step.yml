  Yarn is a package manager that is compatible with the npm registry. Download your app's dependencies via yarn by using this Step.

  ### Configuring the Step

  To use the Step, you need to configure your dependencies in your `package.json` file.

  1. Set a command in **The yarn command to run** input.

     If you leave the input blank, the Step will simply install your dependencies. You can find the other available command in [yarn's documentation](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/).

  1. Set the arguments in the **Arguments for running yarn commands** input.

     You can specify multiple arguments. Check out the available arguments for each command in yarn's documentation.

  You can also cache the contents of the node_modules directory by setting the **Cache node_modules** input to `yes`.

  ### Troubleshooting

  If the Step fails, run it again with verbose logging enabled. To do so, set the **Enable verbose logging** input to `yes`. Doing so allows yarn to output more information about the command you ran.

  Make sure your commands and arguments are correct, and that your packages are correctly defined in the `package.json` file.
