title: Run yarn command
summary: Runs `yarn` with the given command and args.
description: "\nYarn is a package manager that is compatible with the npm registry.
  Download your app's dependencies via yarn by using this Step.  \n\n### Configuring
  the Step\n\nTo use the Step, you need to configure your dependencies in your `package.json`
  file.\n\n1. Set a command in **The yarn command to run** input.\n\n   If you leave
  the input blank, the Step will simply install your dependencies. You can find the
  other available command in [yarn's documentation](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/).\n\n1.
  Set the arguments in the **Arguments for running yarn commands** input.\n\n   You
  can specify multiple arguments. Check out the available arguments for each command
  in yarn's documentation.\n\nYou can also cache the contents of the node_modules
  directory by setting the **Cache node_modules** input to `yes`.\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\nIf
  the Step fails, run it again with verbose logging enabled. To do so, set the **Enable
  verbose logging** input to `yes`. Doing so allows yarn to output more information
  about the command you ran.\n\nMake sure your commands and arguments are correct,
  and that your packages are correctly defined in the `package.json` file.\n\n###
