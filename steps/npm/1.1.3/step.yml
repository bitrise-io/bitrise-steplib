title: Run npm command
summary: The Step runs npm with the command and arguments you provide, for example,
  to install missing packages or run a package's test.
description: "You can install missing JS dependencies with this Step if you insert
  it before any build step and provide the `install` command. \nYou can also test
  certain packages with the `test` command. \nYou can do both in one Workflow, however,
  this requires one **Run npm command** Step for installation followed by another
  **Run npm command** Step for testing purposes.\n\n### Configuring the Step\n1. Add
  the **Run npm command** Step to your Workflow preceding any build Step.\n2. Set
  the **Working directory**.\n3. Set the command you want npm to execute, for example
  `install` to run `npm install` in the **The npm command with arguments to run**
  input.\n4. If you're looking for a particular npm version, you can set it in the
  **Version of npm to use** input.\n5. You can cache the content of the node modules
  directory if you select `true` in the drop-down. \nBy default this input is set
  to false.\n\n### Troubleshooting\nMake sure you insert the Step before any build
  Step so that every dependency is downloaded a build Step starts running.\n\n###
