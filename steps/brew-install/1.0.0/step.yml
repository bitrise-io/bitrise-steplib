title: Brew install
summary: Install or upgrade dependencies with Homebrew.
description: |-
  Install or upgrade dependencies using Homebrew, a package manager for MacOS.

  ### Configuring the Step

  Homebrew defines the available packages as formulae. Our Step needs the name of the Homebrew formulae you want to use, either specified as a step input, or from a Brewfile in the project's source.

  To specify formulae in the step configuration

  1. In the **Formula name** input, put the name of the formula you want to download.
  1. In the **Upgrade formula?** input, set the default behavior for previously installed packages. If the input is set to `yes`, the Step will call `brew reinstall` to upgrade them to the latest version.
  1. In the **Brew install/reinstall options** input, you can set additional flags for the `brew install` or `brew reinstall` commands.

  For the possible options, see [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh/Manpage#install-options-formulacask).

  Alternatively you can install formulae using a Brewfile

  1. Add a `Brewfile` to the root of the project's source. For the format of the Brewfile, see the [Homebrew Bundle documentation](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle#usage)
  1. Set the **Use a Brewfile to install packages?** input to "yes".
  1. (optional) Set the **Path to the Brewfile** input if it is not in the root of the project's source

      If set to `no`, the step won't upgrade other **installed packages** that depend on the package to be installed.

      This helps predictability and install times, but sometimes could cause problems with existing installed packages if they are not compatible with the newly installed package (Homebrew is an evergreen package manager by design). More information is available [here](https://docs.brew.sh/FAQ#why-does-brew-upgrade-formula-or-brew-install-formula-also-upgrade-a-bunch-of-other-stuff) and [here](https://docs.brew.sh/Manpage#install-options-formulacask-).

      If you experience a broken package, set this input to `yes`.

      This input controls the `HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALLED_DEPENDENTS_CHECK` env var.
