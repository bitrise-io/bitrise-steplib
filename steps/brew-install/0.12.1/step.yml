summary: Install or upgrade dependencies with Homebrew.
description: "\nInstall or upgrade dependencies using Homebrew, a package manager
  for MacOS. \n\n### Configuring the Step \n\nHomebrew defines the available packages
  as formulae. Our Step needs the name of the Homebrew formulae you want to use, either
  specified as a step input, or from a Brewfile in the project's source.\n\nTo specify
  formulae in the step configuration\n\n1. In the **Formula name** input, put the
  name of the formula you want to download. \n1. In the **Upgrade formula?** input,
  set the default behavior for previously installed packages. If the input is set
  to `yes`, the Step will call `brew reinstall` to upgrade them to the latest version.\n1.
  In the **Brew install/reinstall options** input, you can set additional flags for
  the `brew install` or `brew reinstall` commands. \n   For the possible options,
  see [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh/Manpage#install-options-formulacask).\n\nAlternatively
  you can install formulae using a Brewfile\n\n1. Add a `Brewfile` to the root of
  the project's source. For the format of the Brewfile, see the [Homebrew Bundle documentation](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle#usage)\n1.
  Set the **Use a Brewfile to install packages?** input to \"yes\". \n1. (optional)
  Set the **Path to the Brewfile** input if it is not in the root of the project's
  source\n\n### Useful links\n\n- [Homebrew documentation](https://docs.brew.sh/Manpage)\n-
