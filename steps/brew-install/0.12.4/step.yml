title: Brew install
summary: Install or upgrade dependencies with Homebrew.
description: |-
  Install or upgrade dependencies using Homebrew, a package manager for MacOS.

  ### Configuring the Step

  Homebrew defines the available packages as formulae. Our Step needs the name of the Homebrew formulae you want to use, either specified as a step input, or from a Brewfile in the project's source.

  To specify formulae in the step configuration

  1. In the **Formula name** input, put the name of the formula you want to download.
  1. In the **Upgrade formula?** input, set the default behavior for previously installed packages. If the input is set to `yes`, the Step will call `brew reinstall` to upgrade them to the latest version.
  1. In the **Brew install/reinstall options** input, you can set additional flags for the `brew install` or `brew reinstall` commands.

  For the possible options, see [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh/Manpage#install-options-formulacask).

  Alternatively you can install formulae using a Brewfile

  1. Add a `Brewfile` to the root of the project's source. For the format of the Brewfile, see the [Homebrew Bundle documentation](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle#usage)
  1. Set the **Use a Brewfile to install packages?** input to "yes".
  1. (optional) Set the **Path to the Brewfile** input if it is not in the root of the project's source
