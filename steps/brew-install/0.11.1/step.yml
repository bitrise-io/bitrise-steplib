description: "\nInstall or upgrade dependencies using Homebrew, a package manager
  for MacOS. \n\n### Configuring the Step \n\nHomebrew defines the available packages
  as formulae. Our Step needs the name of the Homebrew formulae you want to use. \n\n1.
  In the **Formula name** input, put the name of the formula you want to download.
  \n1. In the **Upgrade formula?** input, set the default behavior for previously
  installed packages. If the input is set to `yes`, the Step will call `brew reinstall`
  to upgrade them to the latest version.\n1. In the **Brew install/reinstall options**
  input, you can set additional flags for the `brew install` or `brew reinstall` commands.
  \n   For the possible options, see [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh/Manpage#install-options-formulacask).\n
