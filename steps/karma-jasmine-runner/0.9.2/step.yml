title: Karma Jasmine Test Runner
summary: Run your Jasmine tests with the Karma tool on Bitrise.
description: "The Step allows you to run Jasmine tests using the Karma tool in your
  build. Karma lets you spawn different browsers and re-run the tests within each
  browser. \n\n### Configuring the Step \n\nThe Step runs the `karma start` command
  to run your Jasmine tests. To set this up:\n\n1. Choose the browsers in which you
  want to run tests. Separate each browser with a comma. \n1. In the **Options to
  append to the karma start command**, add custom options to the `karma start` command.
  For the available options, run `karma start --help` in a command line. \n\n### Useful
