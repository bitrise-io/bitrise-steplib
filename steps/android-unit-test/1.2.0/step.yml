      The step will use this pattern to export __Local unit test HTML results__.
      The whole HTML results directory will be zipped and moved to the `$BITRISE_DEPLOY_DIR`.

      You need to override this input if you have custom output dir set for Local unit test HTML results.
      The pattern needs to be relative to the selected module's directory.

      Example 1: app module and debug variant is selected and the HTML report is generated at:

      - `<path_to_your_project>/app/build/reports/tests/testDebugUnitTest`

      this case use: `*build/reports/tests/testDebugUnitTest` pattern.

      Example 2: app module and NO variant is selected and the HTML reports are generated at:

      - `<path_to_your_project>/app/build/reports/tests/testDebugUnitTest`
      - `<path_to_your_project>/app/build/reports/tests/testReleaseUnitTest`

      to export every variant's reports use: `*build/reports/tests` pattern.

      The step will use this pattern to export __Local unit test XML results__.
      The whole XML results directory will be zipped and moved to the `$BITRISE_DEPLOY_DIR`
      and the result files will be deployed to the Ship Addon.

      You need to override this input if you have custom output dir set for Local unit test XML results.
      The pattern needs to be relative to the selected module's directory.

      Example 1: app module and debug variant is selected and the XML report is generated at:

      - `<path_to_your_project>/app/build/test-results/testDebugUnitTest`

      this case use: `*build/test-results/testDebugUnitTest` pattern.

      Example 2: app module and NO variant is selected and the XML reports are generated at:

      - `<path_to_your_project>/app/build/test-results/testDebugUnitTest`
      - `<path_to_your_project>/app/build/test-results/testReleaseUnitTest`

      to export every variant's reports use: `*build/test-results` pattern.

      A test case is considered flaky if it has failed at least once, but passed at least once as well.

      The list contains the test cases in the following format:
      ```
      - TestSuit_1.TestClass_1.TestName_1
      - TestSuit_1.TestClass_1.TestName_2
      - TestSuit_1.TestClass_2.TestName_1
