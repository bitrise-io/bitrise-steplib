      If set to true, the script waits for the test run to complete on
      Devicefarm before returning success/failure. This will slow down your
      Bitrise runs, however allows you to make decisions in subsequent steps
      based on success/failure of the tests.

      Depending on your tests, you may or may not wish to fail the step if
