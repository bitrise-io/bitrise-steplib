title: Save Gradle configuration cache
summary: Caches the Gradle configuration cache folder used by Gradle. Uses the Bitrise
  Build Cache infrastructure.
description: |
  This step caches the Gradle configuration cache folder along with the necessary metadata to speed up future builds. The cache is stored within the Bitrise Build Cache infrastructure.

  For more information on how configuration caching works, refer to the [Gradle user guide](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/configuration_cache.html).

  Unless specified otherwise, the current directory is assumed to be the project directory, and therefore the `./gradle/configuration-cache` directory will be saved.

  **IMPORTANT NOTES:**
  - You must have an active Bitrise Build Cache Trial or Subscription for your workspace to use this step.
  - You also need to set up the encryption key `GRADLE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` in Bitrise Secrets by using the result from running `openssl rand -base64 16`.
  - Setting the encryption key is supported only from Gradle version 8.6 onwards, so your project must be using Gradle 8.6 or higher.

      Manually provided override key used for saving the cache.

      If not specified, by default a key is generated from the app slug and the current branch. If not specified, the contents are also saved to a fallback key consisting only of the app slug. This helps reduce cache misses on new feature branches.
