  ### Automatically manages your iOS Provisioning Profiles for your Xcode project.

  __Setup guide__: [Managing iOS code signing files - automatic provisioning](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/code-signing/ios-code-signing/ios-auto-provisioning/)

  In the case of __Xcode managed codesigning__ projects:

  - downloads the __Xcode managed Provisioning Profiles__ and installs them for the build
  - installs the provided __Codesigning Certificates__ into the Keychain

  In the case of __Manual codesigning__ projects:

  - ensures that the __Application Identifier__ exists on the Apple Developer Portal
  - ensures that the __project's Capabilities__ are set correctly in the Application Identifier
  - ensures that the __Provisioning Profiles__ exist on the Apple Developer Portal and are installed for the build
  - ensure that all the available __Test Devices__ exist on the Apple Developer Portal and are included in the Provisioning Profiles
  - installs the provided __Codesigning Certificates__ into the Keychain

      The Developer Portal team to manage the project's code signing files.

      __If your Developer Portal Account belongs to multiple development team, this input is required!__
      Otherwise specify this input if you want to manage the Provisioning Profiles with a different team than the one set in your project.

      If you leave it empty the team defined by the project will be used.

      The Xcode Configuration to use.

      By default your Scheme defines which Configuration (Debug, Release, ...) should be used,
      but you can overwrite it with this option.

      In the case of __Xcode managed code signing__ projects, by default the step downloads and installs the Xcode managed Provisioning Profiles.

      If this input is set to: `yes`, the step will try to manage the Provisioning Profiles by itself (__like in the case of Manual code signing projects__),
      the step will fall back to use the Xcode managed Provisioning Profiles if there is an issue.

      __This input has no effect in the case of Manual codesigning projects.__

      signing is enabled in the Xcode project?

- min_profile_days_valid: 0
  opts:
    description: |-
      Sometimes you want to sign an app with a Provisioning Profile that is valid for at least 'x' days.

      For example, an enterprise app won't open if your Provisioning Profile is expired. With this parameter, you can have a Provisioning Profile that's at least valid for 'x' days.

      By default (0) it just renews the Provisioning Profile when expired.

      __Provide a development certificate__ url, to ensure development code signing files for the project and __also provide a distribution certificate__ url, to ensure distribution code signing files for your project.
