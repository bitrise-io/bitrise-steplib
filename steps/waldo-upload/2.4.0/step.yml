title: Upload to Waldo
summary: |
  Uploads your build to Waldo.
description: |
  Uploads your build (`.app` or `.apk`) to Waldo.

  You must specify at least a build path and a Waldo upload token.

  Typically the build path is generated by a previous build Step in your
  Workflow. For example:

  - the **Xcode Build for Simulator** Step generates a `.app` at `$BITRISE_APP_DIR_PATH`
  - the **Android Build** Step generates a `.apk` at `$BITRISE_APK_PATH`

  Each application registered in Waldo is associated with a unique upload
  token. You can find the upload token for your app by going to the
  Documentation screen for your app in [Waldo](https://app.waldo.io/). This
  token _should_ be specified as a _secret_ environment variable.
