title: Change Android applicationId
summary: Updates the Android applicationId in your project's `build.gradle` file.
description: |-
  Modifies the applicationId of your Android app by updating applicationId in your project's `build.gradle` file before you'd publish your app to Google Play Store.

  ### Configuring the Step

  1. Insert the **Change Android applicationId** Step before a build Step such as **Android Build** or **Gradle Runner** in your Workflow.
  2. Click the Step to modify its input fields.
  3. Add the file path to the **Path to the build.gradle file** so that the Step knows where to find the file that contains the applicationId attributes.
  4. Provide a new applicationId in the **New applicationId** input. If you leave this input empty, the previous applicationId will be displayed on Google Play Store. The input's value must be a string in this format.

  ### Troubleshooting

  The **Change Android applicationId** Step must be inserted BEFORE the **Android Build** Step as the former makes sure you  upload the build with the right applicationId to Google Play Store.
