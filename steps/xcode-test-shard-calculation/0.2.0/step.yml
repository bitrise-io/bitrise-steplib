title: Xcode test shard calculation
summary: Calculates the test shards for your Xcode tests.
description: |-
  This step looks at the test bundle and calculates the test shards for your Xcode tests. It finds all of the tests and
  divides them into the specified number of shards.

  These shards can be used to run the tests in parallel, which can significantly speed up the testing process. Use the
  [Xcode Test without building](https://www.bitrise.io/integrations/steps/xcode-test-without-building) step's `Test Selection`
  input to specify which test shard information to use.

      The path of the test bundle.

      The step supports the following formats:
      - xcresrun
      - xctestproducts

      It will use the specified file to collect the built tests and generate the test shards.

      Shard the provided test plan's test.

      Leave this input empty to run the default Test Plan or Test Targets associated with the Scheme.

      The input value sets xcodebuild's `-testPlan` option.

      Destination specifier describes the device to use as a destination.

      The input value sets xcodebuild's `-destination` option.

      In a CI environment, a Simulator device called `Bitrise iOS default` is already created.
      It is a compatible device with the selected Simulator runtime, pre-warmed for better performance.

      If a device with this name is not found (e.g. in a local dev environment), the first matching device will be selected.
