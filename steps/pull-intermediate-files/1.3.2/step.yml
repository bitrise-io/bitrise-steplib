summary: The Step downloads Pipeline intermediate files to a local folder.
description: |-
  The Step downloads Pipeline intermediate files to a local folder.
  These intermediate files are generated by Workflows in a Pipeline intended to be shared with subsequent Workflows.

  Make sure to add this Step after you have uploaded the intermediate files.
  You can upload the intermediate files using the [Deploy to Bitrise.io Step](https://www.bitrise.io/integrations/steps/deploy-to-bitrise-io)'s **Files to share between Pipeline Workflows** input.
  The directories you specify will be archived and uploaded as a single file.

  When uploading the Pipeline intermediate files, you must assign environment variable keys to them in the **Files to share between Pipeline Workflows** input.
  After downloading the files, the environment variable key will point to the file's local path.

  When downloading a file, that was a directory originally, they are extracted,
  and the specified environment variable will point to the directory's local path.

  By default, all files shared by any Workflow of the Pipeline are downloaded.
  This can be limited by setting the *Intermediate file source* input.

  Please note that this step is designed to be executed on the CI only.

  ### Configuring the Step

  To configure the Step:

  1. Specify which Workflows' intermediate files to download in the **Intermediate file source** input. By default, all Workflows intermediate files will be downloaded.

    NOTE: You can list multiple Workflows by separating them using a comma. For example: `{workflow1},{workflow2}`

  2. (Optional) Set the **Enable verbose logging** input to `true` if you want to log additional information for debugging purposes.

      A comma (`,`) separated list of Workflow names or Stage and Workflow paths, used to specify which Workflows' files to download.

      **Graph Pipelines:**

      Simply specify the Workflow name directly. For example, `build` or `test`.

      Examples:
      - `build` - Gets intermediate files from the 'build' Workflow.
      - `build,test` - Gets intermediate files from both the 'build' and 'test' Workflows.
      - `test.*` - Gets every intermediate files from all previous Workflows with names starting with 'test'.
      - `.*` - Gets every intermediate files from all previous Workflows.

      **Staged Pipelines:**

      The input uses a `{stage}.{workflow}` syntax.
      The dot character (`.`) is the delimiter between the Stage and the Workflow.

      Examples:
      - `stage1.workflow1` - Gets intermediate files from stage1's workflow1.
      - `stage1\..*` - Gets all intermediate files from stage1's workflows.
      - `.*\.workflow1` - Gets workflow1's intermediate files from all previous stages.
      - `.*` - Gets every intermediate files from all previous stages.

      You can use regular expressions for both pipeline types. Remember to escape special characters.
