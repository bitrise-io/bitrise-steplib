summary: The Step downloads Pipeline intermediate files to a local folder.
description: |-
  The Step downloads Pipeline intermediate files to a local folder.
  These intermediate files are build artifacts generated by Workflows in a Pipeline intended to be shared with subsequent Workflows.

  Make sure to add this Step after you have uploaded the intermediate files.
  You can upload the intermediate files using the [Deploy to Bitrise.io Step](https://www.bitrise.io/integrations/steps/deploy-to-bitrise-io)'s **Files to share between pipeline stages** input.
  The directories you specify will be archived and uploaded as a single file.

  When uploading the Pipeline intermediate files, you must assign environment variable keys to them in the **Files to share between pipeline stages** input.
  After downloading the files, the environment variable key will point to the file's local path.

  When downloading an artifact, that was a directory originally, they are extracted,
  and the specified environment variable will point to the directory's local path.

  By default, all artifacts generated by any workflow of the pipeline are downloaded.
  This can be limited by setting the *Artifact source* input.

  Please note that this step is designed to be executed on the CI only.

  ### Configuring the Step

  To configure the Step:

  1. Specify which workflows' artifacts to download in the **Artifact source** input. By default, all workflows artifacts will be downloaded.

    NOTE: You can list multiple artifacts by separating them using a comma. For example: `{stage1}.{workflow1},{stage2}.{workflow2}`

  2. (Optional) Set the **Enable verbose logging** input to `true` if you want to log additional information for debugging purposes.

      A comma (`,`) separated list of the Stage and Workflow paths (`{stage}.{workflow}`), used to specify which workflows' artifacts to download.

      The input uses a `{stage}.{workflow}` syntax.
      The dot character (`.`) is the delimiter between the Stage and the Workflow.

      You can use regular expressions. Do not forget to escape the special characters.

      Examples:
      - `stage1.workflow1` - Gets the artifacts from the stage1's workflow1.
      - `stage1\..*` - Gets all artifacts from the stage1's workflows.
      - `.*\.workflow1` - Gets workflow1s' artifacts from the previous stages.
      - `.*` - Gets every generated artifacts from the previous stages.
