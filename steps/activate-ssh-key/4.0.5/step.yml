title: Activate SSH key (RSA private key)
summary: Setup the SSH Key to use with the current workflow
description: "This Step makes sure Bitrise has access to your repository and thus
  able to clone your code to our virtual machines. The Step saves the provided private
  key of your SSH keypair to a file and then loads it into the user's ssh-agent with
  `ssh-add`.\n\n### Configuring the Step\n\nBy default, you do not have to change
  anything about the Step's configuration. All you need to do is make sure that you
  registered your key pair on Bitrise and the public key at your Git provider. You
  can generate and register an SSH keypair in two ways.\n\n- Automatically during
  the [app creation process](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/getting-started/adding-a-new-app/#setting-up-ssh-keys).\n-
  Manually during the app creation process or at any other time. You [generate your
  own SSH keys](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/faq/how-to-generate-ssh-keypair/) and
  register them on Bitrise and at your Git provider. The SSH key should not have a
  passphrase! \n\nOptionally, you can save the private key on the virtual machine.
  If a key already exists on the path you specified in the **(Optional) path to save
  the private key** input, it will be overwritten.\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\nIf the
  Step fails, check the public key registered to your Git repository and compare it
  to the public key registered on Bitrise. The most frequent issue is that someone
  deleted or revoked the key on your Git provider's website.\n\nYou can also set the
  **Enable verbose logging** input to `true`. This provides additional information
  in the log.\n\n### Useful links\n\n[Setting up SSH keys](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/getting-started/adding-a-new-app/#setting-up-ssh-keys)\n[How
  can I generate an SSH key pair?](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/faq/how-to-generate-ssh-keypair/)\n\n###
