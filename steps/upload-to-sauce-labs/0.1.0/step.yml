      summary: Your Sauce Labs application name and extension.
      description: |
        This is translated to the File Name in Sauce Labs (and must include the file extension). The extension is used to automatically set the `artifact_path`.

        Sauce Lab's File Name can be used to activate a specific app with the `filename` flag in your Capabilities
        rather than using the File ID automatically generated on upload - `storage:filename=<fileName>.<ext>`.
        A JavaScript example would be: `caps['app'] = 'storage:filename=TestApplication.apk';`
      is_required: true
  - artifact_path:
    opts:
      title: The absolute APK, AAB, IPA, or ZIP path
      summary: Leave empty to use an automatically generated artifact_path.
      description: |
        Generated automatically based on the Sauce Lab application's name set in `sauce_app_name`.
        The extension will be used to gather the `BITRISE_APK_PATH`, `BITRISE_AAB_PATH`, `BITRISE_IPA_PATH`, or `BITRISE_XCARCHIVE_ZIP_PATH`.

        If you're uploading a file in a format other than .apk, .aab, .ipa, or .zip, you will need to provide a value for `artifact_path`.
      is_required: false
  - data_center_url:
    opts:
      title: Request / data center URL
      summary: App storage URL containing the location of your data center
      description: |
        If using the ES East or Europe data center, provide the desired URL for the POST request.
        This step will default to US West (https://api.us-west-1.saucelabs.com/v1/storage/upload) otherwise.
