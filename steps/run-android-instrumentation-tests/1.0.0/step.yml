      The path to the APK to test.

      When you run the [android-build](https://www.bitrise.io/integrations/steps/android-build) or [android-build-for-ui-testing](https://bitrise.io/integrations/steps/android-build-for-ui-testing) Step before this Step, then the generated APK path is exported under the `$BITRISE_APK_PATH` environment variable.

      The path to the test APK that contains instrumentation tests.

      You can easily generate the test APK by running the [android-build-for-ui-testing](https://bitrise.io/integrations/steps/android-build-for-ui-testing) Step before this Step. In this case, the test APK path is exported under the `$BITRISE_TEST_APK_PATH` environment variable.

  opts:
    description: |
      Tests are split evenly by count across shards and run in parallel.

      In general, the more shards you use, the faster your total test run time will be. Make sure not to set this count to be bigger than your actual test count.

      Device configuration where to run tests.

      This is only required when you don't want to run tests on the default emulator configuration.

      The value of this parameter must be a list of key=value pairs where supported keys are:

      -  `model`: device model to use, possible values [`Pixel2`, `NexusLowRes`]
      -  `version`: API version to use

      For example, to test on an low res MDPI device with API 23 specify `model=NexusLowRes,version=23`

      Comma separated list of key=value pairs that are passed as extra options to the `am instrument` command.

      Some common examples of supported extras can be found [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/test/command-line#AMOptionsSyntax)

      Example use-cases:
        * Run second shard out of 3 shards: `numShards=3,shardIndex=1`
        * Run tests in a specific class: `class=com.example.app.MyTestClass`
