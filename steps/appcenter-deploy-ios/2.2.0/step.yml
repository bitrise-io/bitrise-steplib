title: AppCenter iOS Deploy
summary: Distribute your iOS app through Microsoft App Center.
description: |-
  [This Step](https://github.com/bitrise-steplib/steps-appcenter-deploy-ios) integrates with the [App Center](https://appcenter.ms/)'s Distribution service and enables you to distribute your apps seamlessly to different stores, for example, App Store, MS Intune, user groups or even individual testers.

   ### Configuring the Step

   Before you start:

   The Step requires an active MS App Center account.

   1. Add the **IPA path** which points to a binary file.
   2. Add the **DSYM.zip file path**.
   3. Add the AppCenter **API token**.
   4. Add the **Owner name**, which means the owner of the App Center app. For an app owned by a user, the URL in App Center can look like this https://appcenter.ms/users/JoshuaWeber/apps/APIExample where the {ownername} is JoshuaWeber. For an app owned by an organization, the URL can be, for example, https://appcenter.ms/orgs/Microsoft/apps/APIExample where the {ownername} is Microsoft.
   5. Add the **App name** which is the name of the App Center app. For an app owned by a user, the URL in App Center might look like this: https://appcenter.ms/users/JoshuaWeber/apps/APIExample where the {app_name} is APIExample.
   6. Add the **Distribution groups** which means the user groups you wish to distribute the app to. Please add one group name per line.
   7. Add the **Distribution stores** where you wish to distribute the app to. Please add one store name per line.
   8. Add the **Testers** who you wish to send the app to via email. Please add one email address per line.
   9. Add any **Release notes for the deployed artifact**.
   10. Send notification emails to testers and distribution groups with the **Notify Testers** input.
   11. You can enforce the installation of a distribution version with the **Mandatory update** input set to `yes`.
   12. If you set the **Debug** input to `yes`, you can enable verbose logs.
