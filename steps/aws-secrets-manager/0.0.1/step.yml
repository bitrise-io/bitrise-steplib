title: Fetch secrets
summary: Fetch secrets from AWS Secrets Manager
description: |
  The main intention of this custom step is to allow us to store sensitive data on AWS Secrets Manager, and fetching them on-demand during Bitrise workflow execution.

  When a Bitrise workflow runs, this step fetches the secrets from AWS Secrets Manager, based on the list of secrets provided as input.

  Each secret stored on AWS Secrets Manager is represented as a JSON object. For each secret that it fetches, it then retrieve the JSON object value from the secret's JSON object, using a specified JSON object key. The value is then stored in an environment variable, exported and propagated to be consumed in subsequent steps in the workflow.

      The newline separated list of secrets to be fetched from AWS Secrets Manager.

      Each secret itself consists of three components:

        - The ARN of the secret. This can be either full ARN, or partial ARN, which contains only the name of the secret, without the six random character suffix.

        - The secret's JSON object key. The JSON object key for identifying the value that we want to retrieve in the secret's JSON object.

        - The environment variable to store the value in. The environment variable where the JSON object value, identified by the JSON object key, is stored in.
    is_required: true

      Newline separated list of secret. Each secret is delimited with hash symbol, consisting of the secret ARN, the secret's JSON object key, and the environment variable in which to store the corresponding JSON object value in.

      Example: `arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:123456789012:secret:db-credential#username#USERNAME`.
