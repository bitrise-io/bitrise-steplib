title: Save Carthage Cache

  with **Restore Carthage Cache**.
description: |
  Caches prebuilt frameworks in the Carthage folder. This Step needs to be used in combination with **Restore Carthage Cache**.

  This Step is based on [key-based caching](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/en/builds/caching/key-based-caching.html) and sets up the cache key and path automatically for Carthage. If you'd like to change the cache key (or paths to cache), you might want to use the generic [Save cache](https://github.com/bitrise-steplib/bitrise-step-save-cache) Step instead.
