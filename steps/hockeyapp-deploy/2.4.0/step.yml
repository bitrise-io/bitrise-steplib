summary: Deploy your awesome iOS Application to HockeyApp.
description: |-
  Deploy an iOS application to [HockeyApp](http://hockeyapp.net),
  add notes even in markdown format, notify testers, restrict download.

  Register a HockeyApp account at [http://hockeyapp.net/](http://hockeyapp.net)
  and create an app to utilize this step.
  You also need to create a *HockeyApp Token* for your app.

  If app_id is provided the ipa will be upload to the specified app on HockeyApp,
  otherwise HockeyApp will decide based on the bundle id, if it's a new app, or update.

      ## Where to get the HockeyApp API Token?

      Sign in to your [http://hockeyapp.net/](http://hockeyapp.net) account,
      click on your username at the top right corner to get to the
      *Manage Account* page. Select the *API Tokens* option on the left side
      and if you don't have an appropriate API Token for your app or account
      you can register one here.

      You can see your registered API Tokens at the bottom of this page
      at the *Active API Tokens* section. Copy and paste here the API Token
      you want to use.

      **Important:**
      *If no App ID is specified HockeyApp will attach the build
      to an app on HockeyApp based on the bundle ID, or create a new app on HockeyApp
      if it does not match any existing HockeyApp app's bundle ID.*

      *If you set the App ID the build will be uploaded for the specified
      HockeyApp app/project!*

      ## Where to get the HockeyApp App ID?

      If you didn't register your app on [http://hockeyapp.net/](http://hockeyapp.net)
      you first have to do so to get an App ID.

      Once the app is registered select it from the Apps list on the
      Dashboard page and on the left side you'll find the **App ID**
      of the app. Copy and paste it here.
