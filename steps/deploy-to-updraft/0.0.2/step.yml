  via an in-app notification system if the Updraft SDK is integrated.\n- Build Management:
  Updraft simplifies the process of uploading, resigning, and managing different iOS
  and Android app versions, helping ensure that the right versions reach the right
  testers and members.\n- Resigning: Updraft allows you to resign iOS apps with new
  distribution certificates and provisioning profiles. For Android you can add your
  keystore and resign your uploaded .aab files with your keystore to ensure your play
  store release will get accepeted.\n- Integration Support: The platform integrates
  with multiple CI/CD tools and third-party services like Slack, Microsoft Teams,
