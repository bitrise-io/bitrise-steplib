title: Flutter Test
summary: Performs any test in a Flutter project.
description: "\nIf you have tests in your repository, and selected `yes` when prompted
  during app creation, the primary Workflow will include the **Flutter Test** Step
  by default. \nIf you add tests to your app later, add the **Flutter Test** Step
  to your Workflow manually. The Step runs the `flutter test` command with the specified
  flags. To check the available flags, open a command line interface on your own machine
  and run `flutter test --help`.\n\n### Configuring the Step\n1. Provide your project's
  root directory in the **Project Location** field.\n2. The **Step's test result directory**
  is the root directory for all test results created by the Bitrise CLI. This input
  gets filled out automatically.\n3. You can append additional flags to the default
  `flutter test` command in the **Additional parameters** field.\n4. Select 'yes'
  in the **Generate code coverage files** input to get detailed analysis of your code.\n\n\n###
  Troubleshooting\nMake sure the **Project Location** input of the Flutter Test Step
  is correct. \nThe default value is the Environment Variable (Env Var) created for
  your Flutter projectâ€™s location.\n\n\n### Useful links\n- [Getting started with
