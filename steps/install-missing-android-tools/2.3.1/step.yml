title: Install missing Android SDK components
summary: Install missing Android SDK components
description: |-
  This step makes sure that required Android SDK components (platforms and build-tools) are installed.

  The step runs the `gradlew dependencies` command.

  If the _Android Plugin for Gradle_ version is 2.2.0 or higher, the plugin will download and install the missing components during the Gradle command.

  Otherwise the command will fail, the step parses the command's output to determine which SDK components are missing and installs them.

      Using a Gradle Wrapper (gradlew) is required, as the wrapper is what makes sure
      that the right Gradle version is installed and used for the build.
      __You can find more information about the Gradle Wrapper (gradlew),
      and about how you can generate one (if you would not have one already)__
      in the official guide at: [https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html).

      **The path should be relative** to the repository root, for example: `./gradlew`,
      or if it's in a sub directory: `./sub/dir/gradlew`.
