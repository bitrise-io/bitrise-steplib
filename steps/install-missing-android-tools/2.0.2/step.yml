title: Install missing Android SDK components
summary: Install missing Android SDK components
description: "This step makes sure that required Android SDK components (platforms
  and build-tools) are installed.\n\nThe step runs the `gradlew dependencies` command.\n\nIf
  the Plugin version is 2.2.0 or later, the plugin will download and install the missing
  components during the Gradle command.   \nOtherwise the command will fail, the step
  parses the command's output to determine which SDK components are missing and installs
  them."

      Using a Gradle Wrapper (gradlew) is required, as the wrapper is what makes sure
      that the right Gradle version is installed and used for the build.
      __You can find more information about the Gradle Wrapper (gradlew),
      and about how you can generate one (if you would not have one already)__
      in the official guide at: [https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html).

      **The path should be relative** to the repository root, for example: `./gradlew`,
      or if it's in a sub directory: `./sub/dir/gradlew`.
