title: Install missing Android SDK components
summary: Install Android SDK components that are required for the app.
description: "\nThis Step makes sure that required Android SDK components (platforms
  and build-tools) are installed. To do so, the Step runs the `gradlew dependencies`
  command. \n\nIf the Android Plugin for Gradle version is 2.2.0 or higher, the plugin
  will download and install the missing components during the Gradle command.  \nOtherwise
  the command fails and the Step parses the command's output to determine which SDK
  components are missing and installs them.\n\n### Configuring the Step\n\n1. Set
  the path of the `gradlew` file.\n\n   The default value is that of the $PROJECT_LOCATION
  Environment Variable.\n\n1. If you use an Android NDK in your app, set its revision
  in the **NDK Revision** input.\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\nIf the Step fails, check
  that your repo actually contains a `gradlew` file. Without the Gradle wrapper, this
  Step won't work.\n\n### Useful links\n\n[Installing an additional Android SDK package](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/tips-and-tricks/android-tips-and-tricks/#how-to-install-an-additional-android-sdk-package)\n\n###

      Using a Gradle Wrapper (gradlew) is required, as the wrapper is what makes sure
      that the right Gradle version is installed and used for the build.
      __You can find more information about the Gradle Wrapper (gradlew),
      and about how you can generate one (if you would not have one already)__
      in the official guide at: [https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html).

      **The path should be relative** to the repository root, for example: `./gradlew`,
      or if it's in a sub directory: `./sub/dir/gradlew`.
