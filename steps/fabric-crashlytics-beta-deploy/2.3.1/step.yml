  Deploys to Fabric/Crashlytics beta testing service.

  ## How to setup your Xcode project for [Fabric](https://get.fabric.io/) / Crashlytics beta testing?

  * Register a Fabric account at [https://get.fabric.io/](https://get.fabric.io/).
  * Add Fabric & Crashlytics to your Xcode project as described when you first sign into your Fabric account.
  * After your first Fabric & Crashlytics app setup, the app should be listed on [https://fabric.io](https://fabric.io).
  * You should also test that everything works correctly with a manual version upload: just Create an Archive in Xcode, if the Fabric menu bar app is running, it'll show an upload popup.

  Your app is now ready to be deployed with this Step!
