      If set to "true" it'll only set ACL for changed objects, which is
      way faster to do than to check and set every objects' ACL.

      Generally, you can keep this option on "yes" to get a speed boost,
      and you should only change it to "false" if you changed the
      ACL option (in order to force set every object's ACL to the specified one).
