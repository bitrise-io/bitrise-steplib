      If you want to sync only the content of
      the folder but don't want to create the folder, then you
      should append a slash at the end of the path. For example: ./folder/

      If it is set to "true", it'll only set ACL for changed objects, which is
      way faster to do than to check and set every objects' ACL.

      Generally, you can keep this option on "yes" to get a speed boost,
      and you should only change it to "false" if you changed the
      ACL option (to set every object's ACL to the specified one).

      Here you can specify a different AWS region of the bucket. You can leave
      it empty to use the default config/env setting.
