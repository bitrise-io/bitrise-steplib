      (optional) The configuration to use. By default your Scheme
      defines which configuration (Debug, Release, ...) should be used,
      but you can overwrite it with this option.

      **Make sure that the Configuration you specify actually exists
      in your Xcode Project**. If it does not, if you have a typo
      in the value of this input Xcode will simply use the Configuration
      specified by the Scheme and will silently ignore this parameter!
