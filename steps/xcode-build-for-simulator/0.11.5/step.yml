      A couple of examples (the

      are installed):

      * iPhone Xs Max
      * iPad Air (3rd generation)

      * Apple TV 4K (don't forget to set the platform to `tvOS Simulator` to use this option!)

      (optional) The configuration to use. By default your Scheme's archive action
      defines which configuration (Debug, Release, ...) should be used,
      but you can overwrite it with this option.

      **Make sure that the Configuration you specify actually exists
      in your Xcode Project**. If it does not, if you have a typo
      in the value of this input Xcode will simply use the Configuration
      specified by the Scheme and will silently ignore this parameter!

      Could make the build faster by adding `COMPILER_INDEX_STORE_ENABLE=NO` flag to the `xcodebuild` command which will disable the indexing during the build.

      Indexing is needed for

      * Autocomplete
      * Ability to quickly jump to definition
      * Get class and method help by alt clicking.

      Which are not needed in CI environment.

      **Note:** In Xcode you can turn off the `Index-WhileBuilding` feature  by disabling the `Enable Index-WhileBuilding Functionality` in the `Build Settings`.<br/>
      In CI environment you can disable it by adding `COMPILER_INDEX_STORE_ENABLE=NO` flag to the `xcodebuild` command.
    summary: Could make the build faster by disabling the indexing during the build
      run.
