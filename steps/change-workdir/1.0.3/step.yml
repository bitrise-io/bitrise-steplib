title: Change Working Directory for subsequent Steps
summary: Set bitrise source directory (`BITRISE_SOURCE_DIR`) to a specified path.
description: |-
  By setting `$BITRISE_SOURCE_DIR` to the specified path every subsequent
  Step will run with this path as its base Working Directory.

  Useful for projects which expect a fixed project/workspace hierarchy,
  like `Go` which requires the project inside a "workspace" with
  the structure: `$GOPATH/src/domain/user/project`.
