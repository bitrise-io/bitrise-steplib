title: Swift Environment Variable Injector
summary: |
  Step to inject static values from environment variables into Swift code files before compilation and Continuous deployment allowing us to not expose our production keys and values in statically in our code and store sensitive values safe.
description: "This step allows us to inject CI pipelines environment variables values
  into Swift code static values before compilation and Continuous deployment to a
  specific environment(Development, Testing or Production) where we can define the
  values injected for each build and deployment e.g. a API url that the App uses and
  is different for each environment. \nAlso it allows us to not expose our production
  keys and values in statically in our code.\nFor more info, check out the Swift [Variable
  Injector Project](https://github.com/LucianoPAlmeida/variable-injector) on github.\n"
