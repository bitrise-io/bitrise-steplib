title: Flutter Build
summary: Builds a Flutter project.
description: |-
  This Step builds an iOS and an Android app. By default the Step builds the artifact based on the platform the scanner detects.

  ### Configuring the Step
  1. In the **Project Location** input the root directory of your Flutter project is automatically filled out.
  2. Select which platform your project should be built for (`ios`, `android` or `both`).
  3. Enable **Debug** option to get verbose logs and see where the Step is failing.

  Depending on the selected platform/s, continue with the rest of the config inputs.

  #### Configuring for an iOS app
  1. Make sure the **Platform input** is set to `iOS` or `both`.
  2. In **Codesign Identity** you can onverride the code signing identities that you set in Flutter.
  3. In **Additional parameters** add any flag to customize your build (for example, the `--release` flag appended to `flutter build io` builds a deployable iOS app).
  4. Leave the **Output pattern** input's default value as is or modify it to the pattern if your build artifacts are stored elsewhere.
  5. Make sure you have the **Xcode Archive & Export for iOS** Step after the **Flutter Build** Step in your Workflow.

  #### Configuring for an Android app
  1. Insert the **Android Sign** Step after the **Flutter Build** Step and make sure code signing files are uploaded to the **Code Signing** tab.
  2. Make sure the **Platform input** is set to `Android` or `both`.
  3. Scroll down to the `Android Platform Configs` input section, and select the preferred output artifact type you wish to generate in the **Android output artifact type** input. The Step can build an APK and an Android App Bundle as well.
  4. Append any flag to the `build` command in the **Additional parameters** input.
  5. Leave the **Output pattern** input's default value as is or modify it to the pattern if your build artifacts are stored elsewhere.

  ### Troubleshooting

  Make sure the **Flutter Install** Step is before the **Flutter Build** Step.
  If you have not set up code signing correctly, some code signing related issue will definitely surface by this build Step.
  If you're unsure about code signing, consult our guide linked in Useful links.
