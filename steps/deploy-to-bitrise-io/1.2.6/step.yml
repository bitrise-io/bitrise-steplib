      Specify the directory or file path which will be deployed.
      If the specified path is a directory then every file
      in the directory will be deployed - but only the
      files in the specified directory, sub-directories
      won't be uploaded. For uploading the directory's content
      recursively you should use the *Compress* option
      which will compress the whole directory, with
      every sub-directory included.

      If you specify a file path then only the specified
      file will be deployed.

      found in the *Deploy directory* folder will be deployed
      separately.
