title: Deploy to Bitrise.io - Apps, Logs, Artifacts
summary: Deploys build artifacts to make them available for the user on the build's
  **APPS & ARTIFACTS** tab. Sends test results to the Test Reports add-on.
description: "The Step collects artifacts from previous Steps in the Workflow and
  places them in a specified deploy directory or compresses them into a single .zip
  file in the deploy directory. These artifacts are then available on the **APPS &
  ARTIFACTS** tab of any given build. For installable artifacts, such as IPAs or APKs,
  the Step can create a public install page that allows testers to install the app
  on their devices. You can also use the Step to notify users about the build.\n\nThis
  Step is required in order to use the Test Reports add-on. It converts the test results
  to the right format and sends them to the add-on.\n\n### Configuring the Step\n\n1.
  Set the value for the Deploy directory of file path. The default is the $BITRISE_DEPLOY_DIR
  environment variable which is exposed by the Bitrise CLI.\n2. Set the **Notify:
  User Roles** and the **Notify: Emails** inputs to configure notifications for the
  users. Note that the **Notify: Emails** input is only used if a public install page
  is created and you must use a Secret to set it.\n3. Optionally, you can create a
  zip file for all your build artifacts by setting the **Compress the artifacts into
  one file?** input to `true`. \n\nGet a public install page that allows testers to
  install the app on their devices:\n\n1. Set the **Enable public page for the App?**
  input to `true`.\n2. Set the **Compress the artifacts into one file?** input to
  `false`. If all the contents of the deploy directory are compressed into a single
  zip file, there won't be a public install page.\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\nIf your
  users did not get notified via email, check the **Enable public page for the App?**
  input. If it is set to `false`, no email notifications will be sent.\n\nIf you can't
  find the artifacts on the **APPS & ARTIFACTS** tab, check the **Deploy directory
  or file path** input. You can use [remote access](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/builds/remote-access/)
  to check if your artifacts are available at the specified location.\n\n### Useful

      Specify the directory or file path which will be deployed.
      If the specified path is a directory, then every file
      in the specified directory will be deployed, sub-directories, however,
      won't be uploaded. To upload the directory's content
      recursively, you should use the *Compress* option
      which will compress the whole directory, with
      every sub-directory included.

      If you specify a file path, then only the specified
      file will be deployed.

      An example to notify your developers and testers:

      If you want to notify everyone in the app's team, just specify `everyone`.
