title: Deploy to Bitrise.io - Build Artifacts, Test Reports, and Pipeline intermediate
  files
summary: |-
  Deploys build artifacts to make them available for the user on the build's **Artifacts** tab.
  Sends test results to the Test Reports add-on (build's **Tests** tab).
  Uploads Pipeline intermediate files to make them available in subsequent Stages and also uploads Bitrise and user generated html reports.
description: |-
  The Step accesses artifacts from a directory specified as the `$BITRISE_DEPLOY_DIR` where artifacts generated by previous Steps gets stored.
  These artifacts are then uploaded on the **Artifacts** tab of any given build. For installable artifacts, such as IPAs or APKs, the Step can create a public install page that allows testers to install the app on their devices.
  You can also use the Step to notify users about the build. If you wish to use the Test Reports add-on, you must add this Step in your Workflow since the Step converts test results to the right format and sends them to the add-on.
  The Step can also share Pipeline intermediate files. These files are build artifacts generated by Workflows in a Pipeline intended to be shared with subsequent Stages.
  Also it collects and uploads all of the html reports located in the `BITRISE_HTML_REPORT_DIR` folder.

  ### Configuring the Build Artifact Deployment section of the Step

  1. Set the value for the **Deploy directory or file path** required input. The default value is the `$BITRISE_DEPLOY_DIR` Env Var which is exposed by the Bitrise CLI.
  If you provide a directory, everything in that directory, excluding sub-directories, gets uploaded.
  If you provide only a file, then only that file gets uploaded.
  To upload a directory's content recursively, you should use the **Compress the artifacts into one file?** which will compress the whole directory, with every sub-directory included.
  2. Set the value of the **Notify: User Roles** input. It sends an email with the [public install URL](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/deploy/bitrise-app-deployment/) to those Bitrise users whose roles are included in this field.
  The default value is `everyone`. If you wish to notify based on user roles, add one or more roles and separate them with commas, for example, `developers`, `admins`. If you don't want to notify anyone, set the input to `none`.
  3. Set the **Notify: Emails** sensitive input. It sends the public install URL in an email to the email addresses provided here. If you’re adding multiple email address, make sure to separate them with commas.
  The recipients do not have to be in your Bitrise team. Please note that if the email address is associated with a Bitrise account, the user must be [watching](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/builds/configuring-notifications/#watching-an-app) the app.
  4. The **Enable public page for the App?** required input is set to `true` by default. It creates a long and random URL which can be shared with those who do not have a Bitrise account.
  If you set this input to `false`, the **Notify: Emails** input will be ignored and the **Notify: User Roles** will receive the build URL instead of the public install URL.
  5. With the **Compress the artifacts into one file?** required input set to `true`, you can compress the artifacts found in the Deploy directory into a single file.
  You can specify a custom name for the zip file with the `zip_name` option. If you don't specify one, the default `Deploy directory` name will be used.
  If the **Compress the artifacts into one file?** is set to `false`, the artifacts in the Deploy directory will be deployed separately.
  6. With the **Format for the BITRISE_PUBLIC_INSTALL_PAGE_URL_MAP output** required input field, you can customize the output format of the public install page’s multiple artifact URLs so that the next Step can render the output (for example, our **Send a Slack message** Step).
  Provide a language template description using [https://golang.org/pkg/text/template](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template) so that the **Deploy to Bitrise.io** Step can build the required custom output.
  7. With the **Format for the BITRISE_PERMANENT_DOWNLOAD_URL_MAP output** required input, you can customize the output format of the `BITRISE_PERMANENT_DOWNLOAD_URL_MAP` so that the next Step can render the output.
  The next Steps will use this input to generate the related output in the specified format. The output contains multiple permanent URLs for multiple artifacts.
  Provide a language template description using [https://golang.org/pkg/text/template](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template) so that the **Deploy to Bitrise.io** Step can build the required custom output.
  8. The **Test API's base URL** and the **API Token** input fields are automatically populated for you.
  9. The html report upload does not have any specific settings because it will happen automatically.

  ### Configuring the Pipeline Intermediate File Sharing section of the Step

  The **Files to share between pipeline stages** input specifies the files meant to be intermediate files shared between the Pipeline Stages. When uploading the Pipeline intermediate files, you must assign environment variable keys to them in the **Files to share between pipeline stages** input.
  The inputs `path:env_key` values will be saved together with the file and later automatically reconstructed by the [Pull Pipeline intermediate files Step](https://www.bitrise.io/integrations/steps/pull-intermediate-files).
  You can use a shorthand of just `env_var` for `$env_var:env_var`, when the `env_var` holds the path to the file(s) you want to share with subsequent stages.
  The directories you specify will be archived and uploaded as a single file.

  #### Configuring the Debug section of the Step

  If you wish to use any of the Step’s debug features, set the following inputs:
  1. In the **Name of the compressed artifact (without .zip extension)** input you can add a custom name for the compressed artifact. If you leave this input empty, the default `Deploy directory` name is used.
  Please note that this input only works if you set the **Compress the artifacts into one file?** input to `true`.
  2. The **Bitrise Build URL** and the **Bitrise Build API Token** inputs are automatically populated.
  3. If **The Enable Debug Mode** required input is set to `true`, the Step prints more verbose logs. It is `false` by default.
  4. If you need a specific [bundletool version](https://github.com/google/bundletool/releases) other than the default value, you can modify the value of the **Bundletool version** required input.
  Bundletool generates an APK from an Android App Bundle so that you can test the APK.

  ### Troubleshooting

  - If your users did not get notified via email, check the **Enable public page for the App?** input. If it is set to `false`, no email notifications will be sent.
  - If there are no artifacts uploaded on the **APPS & ARTIFACTS tab**, then check the logs to see if the directory you used in the **Deploy directory or file path** input contained any artifacts.
  - If the email is not received, we recommend, that you check if the email is associated with Bitrise account and if so, if the account is “watching” the app.
