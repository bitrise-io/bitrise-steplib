title: Deploy to Bitrise.io - Apps, Logs, Artifacts
summary: Deploys build artifacts to make them available for the user on the build's
  **APPS & ARTIFACTS** tab. Sends test results to the Test Reports add-on.
description: "The Step accesses artifacts from a directory specified as the `$BITRISE_DEPLOY_DIR`
  where artifacts generated by previous Steps gets stored. \nThese artifacts are then
  uploaded on the **APPS & ARTIFACTS** tab of any given build. For installable artifacts,
  such as IPAs or APKs, the Step can create a public install page that allows testers
  to install the app on their devices. \nYou can also use the Step to notify users
  about the build. If you wish to use the Test Reports add-on, you must add this Step
  in your Workflow since the Step converts test results to the right format and sends
  them to the add-on.\n\n### Configuring the Step\n\n1. Set the value for the **Deploy
  directory or file path** required input. The default value is the `$BITRISE_DEPLOY_DIR`
  Env Var which is exposed by the Bitrise CLI.\nIf you provide a directory, everything
  in that directory, excluding sub-directories, gets uploaded. \nIf you provide only
  a file, then only that file gets uploaded. \nTo upload a directory's content recursively,
  you should use the **Compress the artifacts into one file?** which will compress
  the whole directory, with every sub-directory included.\n2. Set the value of the
  **Notify: User Roles** input. It sends an email with the [public install URL](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/deploy/bitrise-app-deployment/)
  to those Bitrise users whose roles are included in this field. \nThe default value
  is `everyone`. If you wish to notify based on user roles, add one or more roles
  and separate them with commas, for example, `developers`, `admins`. If you don't
  want to notify anyone, set the input to `none`.\n3. Set the **Notify: Emails** sensitive
  input. It sends the public install URL in an email to the email addresses provided
  here. If you’re adding multiple email address, make sure to separate them with commas.
  \nThe recipients do not have to be in your Bitrise team. Please note that if the
  email address is associated with a Bitrise account, the user must be [watching](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/builds/configuring-notifications/#watching-an-app)
  the app.\n4. The **Enable public page for the App?** required input is set to `true`
  by default. It creates a long and random URL which can be shared with those who
  do not have a Bitrise account. \nIf you set this input to `false`, the **Notify:
  Emails** input will be ignored and the **Notify: User Roles** will receive the build
  URL instead of the public install URL.\n5. With the **Compress the artifacts into
  one file?** required input set to `true`, you can compress the artifacts found in
  the Deploy directory into a single file.\nYou can specify a custom name for the
  zip file with the `zip_name` option. If you don't specify one, the default `Deploy
  directory` name will be used. \nIf the **Compress the artifacts into one file?**
  is set to `false`, the artifacts in the Deploy directory will be deployed separately.\n6.
  With the **Format for the BITRISE_PUBLIC_INSTALL_PAGE_URL_MAP output** required
  input field, you can customize the output format of the public install page’s multiple
  artifact URLs so that the next Step can render the output (for example, our **Send
  a Slack message** Step). \nProvide a language template description using [https://golang.org/pkg/text/template](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template)
  so that the **Deploy to Bitrise.io** Step can build the required custom output.\n7.
  With the **Format for the BITRISE_PERMANENT_DOWNLOAD_URL_MAP output** required input,
  you can customize the output format of the `BITRISE_PERMANENT_DOWNLOAD_URL_MAP`
  so that the next Step can render the output.\nThe next Steps will use this input
  to generate the related output in the specified format. The output contains multiple
  permanent URLs for multiple artifacts.\nProvide a language template description
  using [https://golang.org/pkg/text/template](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template)
  so that the **Deploy to Bitrise.io** Step can build the required custom output.\n8.
  The **Test API's base URL** and the **API Token** input fields are automatically
  populated for you.\n\n#### Configuring the Debug section of the Step\n\nIf you wish
  to use any of the Step’s debug features, set the following inputs:\n1. In the **Name
  of the compressed artifact (without .zip extension)** input you can add a custom
  name for the compressed artifact. If you leave this input empty, the default `Deploy
  directory` name is used.\nPlease note that this input only works if you set the
  **Compress the artifacts into one file?** input to `true`.\n2. The **Bitrise Build
  URL** and the **Bitrise Build API Token** inputs are automatically populated.\n3.
  If **The Enable Debug Mode** required input is set to `true`, the Step prints more
  verbose logs. It is `false` by default. \n4. If you need a specific [bundletool
  version](https://github.com/google/bundletool/releases) other than the default value,
  you can modify the value of the **Bundletool version** required input. \nBundletool
  generates an APK from an Android App Bundle so that you can test the APK.\n\n###
  Troubleshooting\n\n- If your users did not get notified via email, check the **Enable
  public page for the App?** input. If it is set to `false`, no email notifications
  will be sent.\n- If there are no artifacts uploaded on the **APPS & ARTIFACTS tab**,
  then check the logs to see if the directory you used in the **Deploy directory or
  file path** input contained any artifacts. \n- If the email is not received, we
  recommend, that you check if the email is associated with Bitrise account and if
  so, if the account is “watching” the app.\n\n### Useful links\n\n- [Deployment on
