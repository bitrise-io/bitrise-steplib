title: iOS Auto Provision with App Store Connect API
summary: Automatically manages your iOS Provisioning Profiles for your Xcode project.
description: "The Step uses the official [App Store Connect API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/generating_tokens_for_api_requests).
  \nThe Steps performs the following:\n- It generates, updates and downloads the provisioning
  profiles needed for your iOS project.\n- It verifies if your project is registered
  with the App Store Connect. If it was not, the Step registers your project.\n- It
  registers the iOS devices connected to your Bitrise account with the App Store Connect.\n-
  It modifies the iOS project to use manual code signing if the project uses automatically
  managed signing.\n\n### Configuring the Step\n\nBefore you start configuring the
  Step, make sure you've completed the following requirements:\n1. You've generated
  an [API key](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/creating_api_keys_for_app_store_connect_api)
  and obtained an **Issuer ID**, **Key ID** and a **Private Key**.\n2. You've [defined
  your Apple Developer Account to Bitrise](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/getting-started/configuring-bitrise-steps-that-require-apple-developer-account-data/#defining-your-apple-developer-account-to-bitrise).\n3.
  You've [assigned an Apple Developer Account to your app](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/getting-started/configuring-bitrise-steps-that-require-apple-developer-account-data/#assigning-an-apple-developer-account-for-your-app).\n\nOnce
  these are done, most of the required Step input fields are already populated for
  you.\n\nTo configure the Step:\n\n1. Add the **iOS Auto Provision with App Store
  Connect API** after any dependency installer Step in your Workflow, such as **Run
  CocoaPods install** or **Carthage**.\n2. Click the Step to edit its input fields.
  You can see that the **Build API token**, **Build URL**, and the **Xcode Project
  (or Workspace) path** inputs are automatically filled out for you.\n    - **Build
  API token**: Every running build has a temporary API token on a Bitrise virtual
  machine. This token is only available while the build is running. The Step downloads
  the connected API key with the help of this API token and Bitrise saves it in a
  JSON file.\n    - **Build URL**: URL of the current build or local path URL to your
  `apple_developer_portal_data.json`.\n    - **Xcode Project path**: The path where
  the `.xcodeproj` / `.xcworkspace` is located.\n3. **Distribution type** input's
  value has to match with the value of the **Select method for export** input in the
  **Xcode Archive & Export for iOS** Step.\n4. With the **Scheme name** input you
  can restrict which targets to process.\n\n### Troubleshooting\nMake sure you do
  not have the **Certificate and Profile Installer** Step in your Workflow.\nMake
  sure that you do NOT modify your Xcode project between the **iOS Auto Provision
  with App Store Connect API** and the **Xcode Archive & Export for iOS** Steps. For
  example, do not change the **bundle ID** after the **iOS Auto Provision with App
  Store Connect API** Step.\n\n### Useful links\n- [Managing iOS code signing files

      The input determines the method used for Apple Service authentication. By default, the Bitrise Apple Developer connection based on API key is used and other authentication-related Step inputs are ignored.

      You can either use the established Bitrise Apple Developer connection or you can tell the Step to only use the Step inputs for authentication.
      - `automatic`: Use the Apple Developer connection based on API key. Step inputs are only used as a fallback.
      - `api_key`: Use the Apple Developer connection based on API key authentication. Authentication-related Step inputs are ignored.
      - `off`: Do not use any already configured Apple Developer Connection. Only authentication-related Step inputs are considered.

      **NOTE:** The Step will only recognize the API key if the filename includes the  `KEY_ID` value as shown on the examples above.

      You can upload your key on the **Generic File Storage** tab in the Workflow Editor and set the Environment Variable for the file here.
