title: Update JIRA issues with build number
summary: Update fields of JIRA issues with build number.
description: "Update fields of JIRA issues associated with current MR/PR, with the
  current build number.\n\n### How does it work?\n\nFirst, the step needs to know
  tasks associated with the build, so it examines Git history of the merge that it
  was triggered by. \nEach merge request can have multiple tasks related to it. So
  step extracts all the messages of commits involved from the merge commit, \nand
  it looks for task keys using a predefined format (for example, [ABCD-1234]). Then
  using JIRA API, it updates custom fields of these tasks with current build number.
  \n\nAdditionally step can keep ticket history from failed/aborted builds. It uses
  Bitrise API to gather information about the commits \nfrom all aborted or failed
  builds preceding the current one.\n\nThe step does not clone git repository by itself,
  instead it is using the one located at `$BITRISE_SOURCE_DIR`. \nMake sure repository
  is cloned before using it ([guide](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/en/steps-and-workflows/generic-workflow-recipes/cloning-a-git-repository.html)).\n\n###
