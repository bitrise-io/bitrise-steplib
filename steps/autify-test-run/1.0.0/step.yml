title: Autify test run
summary: |
  Run a test plan on Autify for Mobile.
description: |
  [Autify for Mobile](https://autify.com/mobile) is a test automation platform for your native app.
  This step allows you to upload your app built in the previous steps to Autify and start a pre-recorded test plan against the build.

  Optionally, this step can wait until the test plan finishes and fail if it doesn't pass.

  Also, you can specify already uploaded build and just start a test plan against it.

  If you want to upload your app to Autify, you need to build your app first by `Android Build`, `Xcode build for simulator`, etc.
  and refer the target build path (*.apk or *.app) at `Build path to test` input.
