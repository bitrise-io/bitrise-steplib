title: Bitrise.io Cache:Pull
summary: Download the build cache from bitrise.io.
description: |-
  Downloads the build cache from bitrise.io, and moves the files back to
  their original place. The aim is to speed up your builds as not having to download every single dependency every time can be a serious timesaver.

  ### Configuring the Step

  To be able to pull from a previous build's cache, you need two things.

  1. The **Cache:Push** Step at the end of your Workflow.
  2. At least one successful build on the same branch in the last seven days.

  If there was no successful build on the branch in question in the last seven days, the cache automatically gets deleted.

  ### Troubleshooting

  If the Step fails, check the time of the latest build. If there was a successful build in the last seven days, check if the Workflow included the **Cache:Push** Step.

  If the **Cache:Push** Step was present, check the inputs of the Step. It's possible, for example, that the provided cache path is incorrect.
