title: Xcode Test for iOS
summary: Runs your project's pre-defined Xcode tests on every build.
description: "This Steps runs all those Xcode tests that are included in your project.
  \nThe Step will work out of the box if your project has test targets and your Workflow
  has the **Deploy to Bitrise.io** Step which exports the test results and (code coverage
  files if needed) to the Test Reports page. \nThis Step does not need any code signing
  files since the Step deploys only the test results to [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io).\n\n###
  Configuring the Step\nIf you click into the Step, there are some required input
  fields whose input must be set in accordance with the Xcode configuration of the
  project.  \nThe **Scheme name** input field must be marked as Shared in Xcode. \nThe
  **Device**, **OS version**, **Platform** input fields must be set to the value that's
  shown in Xcode’s device selection dropdown menu.\nIf you wish to export code coverage
  files as well, set the \"Generate code coverage files?\" to `yes`.\n\n### Troubleshooting\nIf
  the **Deploy to Bitrise.io** Step is missing from your Workflow, then the **Xcode
  Test for iOS** Step will not be able to export the test results on the Test Reports
  page and you won't be able to view them either.\nThe xcpretty output tool does not
  support parallel tests. \nIf parallel tests are enabled in your project, go to the
  Step’s Debug section and set the **Output tool** input’s value to xcodebuild.\nIf
  the Xcode test fails with the error `Unable to find a destination matching the provided
  destination specifier`, then check our [system reports](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io/tree/master/system_reports)
  to see if the requested simulator is on the stack or not. \nIf it is not, then pick
  a simulator that is on the stack.\n\n### Useful links\n- [About Test Reports](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/testing/test-reports/)\n-

      Could make the build faster by adding `COMPILER_INDEX_STORE_ENABLE=NO` flag to the `xcodebuild` command which will disable the indexing during the build.

      Indexing is needed for

      * Autocomplete
      * Ability to quickly jump to definition
      * Get class and method help by alt clicking.

      Which are not needed in CI environment.

      **Note:** In Xcode you can turn off the `Index-WhileBuilding` feature  by disabling the `Enable Index-WhileBuilding Functionality` in the `Build Settings`.<br/>
      In CI environment you can disable it by adding `COMPILER_INDEX_STORE_ENABLE=NO` flag to the `xcodebuild` command.

      Previous Xcode versions and configurations may throw the error `iPhoneSimulator: Timed out waiting 120 seconds for simulator to boot, current state is 1.`
      when the compilation before performing the tests takes too long.

      This is fixed by running `xcodebuild OPTIONS build test OPTIONS` instead of `xcodebuild OPTIONS test OPTIONS`.
      Calling an explicit build before the test results in the code being compiled twice, thus creating an overhead.

      Unless you are sure that your configuration is not prone to this error, it is recommended to leave this option turned on.
