title: Xcode Test for iOS
summary: Runs your project's pre-defined Xcode tests on every build.
description: |-
  This Steps runs all those Xcode tests that are included in your project.
  The Step will work out of the box if your project has test targets and your Workflow has the **Deploy to Bitrise.io** Step which exports the test results and (code coverage files if needed) to the Test Reports page.
  This Step does not need any code signing files since the Step deploys only the test results to [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io).

  ### Configuring the Step
  If you click into the Step, there are some required input fields whose input must be set in accordance with the Xcode configuration of the project.
  The **Scheme** input field must be marked as Shared in Xcode.

  ### Troubleshooting
  If the **Deploy to Bitrise.io** Step is missing from your Workflow, then the **Xcode Test for iOS** Step will not be able to export the test results on the Test Reports page and you won't be able to view them either.
  The xcpretty output tool does not support parallel tests.
  If parallel tests are enabled in your project, go to the Step's **xcodebuild log formatting** section and set the **Log formatter** input's value to `xcodebuild` or `xcbeautify`.
  If the Xcode test fails with the error `Unable to find a destination matching the provided destination specifier`, then check our [system reports](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io/tree/master/system_reports) to see if the requested simulator is on the stack or not.
  If it is not, then pick a simulator that is on the stack.

      The input value sets xcodebuild's `-destination` option.

      In a CI environment, a Simulator device called `Bitrise iOS default` is already created.
      It is a compatible device with the selected Simulator runtime, pre-warmed for better performance.

      If a device with this name is not found (e.g. in a local dev environment), the first matching device will be selected.

      Determines how the tests will repeat.

      Available options:
      - `none`: Tests will never repeat.
      - `until_failure`: Tests will repeat until failure or up to maximum repetitions.
      - `retry_on_failure`: Only failed tests will repeat up to maximum repetitions.
      - `up_until_maximum_repetitions`: Tests will repeat up until maximum repetitions.

      The input value together with Maximum Test Repetitions (`maximum_test_repetitions`) input sets xcodebuild's `-run-tests-until-failure` / `-retry-tests-on-failure` or `-test-iterations` option.

      If this input is set, the Step will rerun the tests in the case of failed tests.

      Note that all the tests will be rerun, not just the ones that failed.

      This input is not available if you are using Xcode 13+. In that case, we recommend using the `retry_on_failure` Test Repetition Mode (`test_repetition_mode`).

      Build settings to override the project's build settings, using xcodebuild's `-xcconfig` option.

      You can't define `-xcconfig` option in `Additional options for the xcodebuild command` if this input is set.

      If empty, no setting is changed. When set it can be either:
      1.  Existing `.xcconfig` file path.

          Example:

          `./ios-sample/ios-sample/Configurations/Dev.xcconfig`

      2.  The contents of a newly created temporary `.xcconfig` file. (This is the default.)

          Build settings must be separated by newline character (`\n`).

          Example:
          ```
          COMPILER_INDEX_STORE_ENABLE = NO
          ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH[config=Debug][sdk=*][arch=*] = YES
