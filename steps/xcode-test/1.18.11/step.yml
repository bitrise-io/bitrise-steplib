  Runs Xcode's `test` action, on an iOS project.

  Write the tests and run them on every build just to make sure those tiny
  code goblins didn't put something in the code that shouldn't be there while
  you were at the daily Scrum meeting.

      A couple of examples (the

      are installed):

      * iPhone 6 Plus

      Options added to the end of the `xcodebuild build test` call.

      If you leave empty this input, xcodebuild will be called as:

      `xcodebuild
        -project\-workspace PROJECT.xcodeproj\WORKSPACE.xcworkspace
        -scheme SCHEME
        build test
        -destination platform=PLATFORM Simulator,name=NAME,OS=VERSION`

      In case of `generate_code_coverage_files: "yes"`
      `xcodebuild` gets two additional flags:

      * GCC_INSTRUMENT_PROGRAM_FLOW_ARCS=YES
      * GCC_GENERATE_TEST_COVERAGE_FILES=YES

      If you want to add more options, list that separated by space character.

      If `single_build: false` step runs `xcodebuild OPTIONS build OPTIONS` before the test,
      to generate the project derived datas. After that comes `xcodebuild OPTIONS build test OPTIONS`,
      which command's log is presented in the step's log.

      If `single_build: true`, then step calls only `xcodebuild OPTIONS build test OPTIONS`.

      Previous Xcode versions and configurations may throw the error `iPhoneSimulator: Timed out waiting 120 seconds for simulator to boot, current state is 1.`
      when the compilation before performing the tests takes too long.

      This is fixed by running `xcodebuild OPTIONS build test OPTIONS` instead of `xcodebuild OPTIONS test OPTIONS`.
      Calling an explicit build before the test results in the code being compiled twice, thus creating an overhead.

      Unless you are sure that your configuration is not prone to this error, it is recommended to leave this option turned on.

      Options added to the end of the `xcpretty` test call.
