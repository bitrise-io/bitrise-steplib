title: Run Swift Test With Code Coverage
summary: |
  Step that runs SPM tests on macOS, outputting an XML/HTML test result file and Code Coverage JSON file
description: |
  This step uses xcodebuild & xcpretty to run the macOS tests for the Swift Package Manager. The final files are
  output in a structure compatible with the "Test Report" plugin and can be configured to be JUnit or HTML as output,
  so the generated files are compatible with tools like Danger.
  The Code coverage is always exported as a JSON file.
