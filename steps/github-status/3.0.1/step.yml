title: GitHub Status
summary: Update commit status for GitHub repositories.
description: "This Step updates the commit status for a GitHub repository (repo) of
  your choice with this build's status. Useful anytime you can not or do not want
  to provide Bitrise write access to your git repo.\n\n### Configuring the Step\n\n1.
  In the **Authorization token for GitHub applications** Step input, you need to provide
  a token you generated on [GitHub](https://github.com/settings/tokens), with `repo/repo:status`
  scope.\n2. The **Repository URL** input is populated automatically with a variable
  the value of which is taken from the repository field of the Settings of your app.\n3.
  The **Commit hash** input is filled in by default with the variable inherited from
  the **Git Clone** Step.\n4. The **Build URL** Step input is also filled in automatically,
  this is the URL that is forwarded to GitHub as the source of the status.\n5. The
  **GitHub API base URL** is the URL for GitHub's API service, has to be modified
  if you are running an Enterprise GitHub instance.\n6. With the **Status Identifier**
  Step input, you can adjust under what name which CI status shows up.\n7. The input
  **Set Specific Status** has a default value of `auto` which reflects the status
  of the build, but this input allows you to update the commit with any given status,
  regardless of the outcome of the build.\n8. The **Description** input allows you
  to provide a short description for the status. \n9. **Verbose logging** can be turned
  on to print out additional information within the build logs. \n\n### Troubleshooting\n\nIf
  you get a 404 response when running the Step, check your token's scope and validity.\nIf
  you use GitHub Enterprise, make sure your API base URL is set to `http(s)://hostname/api/v3/`.\nIf
  you do not see your status being reflected, double-check **Repository URL** and
  **Commit hash** input values. \n\n### Useful links\n\n- [GitHub Statuses](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/statuses/)\n\n###
