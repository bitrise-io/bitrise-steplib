      The method for exporting the application.

      - `development`: Save a copy of the application signed with your Development identity.
      - `app-store`: Sign and package application for distribution in the Mac App Store.
      - `developer-id`: Save a copy of the application signed with your Developer ID.
      - `none`: Export a copy of the application without re-signing.

      See `xcodebuild -help` for more information.

      Used for Xcode version 7 and above.

      Specifies a custom export options plist content that configures archive exporting.
      If empty, step generates these options based on provisioning profile,
      with default values.

      Auto generated export options available for export methods:

      - app-store
      - ad-hoc
      - enterprise
      - development

      If the step doesn't find an export method based on the provisioning profile(s), the development method will be used.

      Call `xcodebuild -help` for available export options.

      (optional) The configuration to use. By default, your Scheme

      but you can overwrite it with this option.
      **Make sure that the Configuration you specify actually exists
      in your Xcode Project**. If it does not (for example, if you have a typo
      in the value of this input), Xcode will simply use the Configuration
      specified by the Scheme and will silently ignore this parameter!

      Could make the build faster by adding `COMPILER_INDEX_STORE_ENABLE=NO` flag to the `xcodebuild` command which will disable the indexing during the build.

      Indexing is needed for

      * Autocomplete
      * Ability to quickly jump to definition
      * Get class and method help by alt clicking.

      Which are not needed in CI environment.

      **Note:** In Xcode you can turn off the `Index-WhileBuilding` feature  by disabling the `Enable Index-WhileBuilding Functionality` in the `Build Settings`.<br/>
      In CI environment you can disable it by adding `COMPILER_INDEX_STORE_ENABLE=NO` flag to the `xcodebuild` command.
    summary: Could make the build faster by disabling the indexing during the build
      run.

      Used for Xcode version 8 and above.

      Force xcodebuild to use the specified Developer Portal team during archive.

      Format example:

      - `1MZX23ABCD4`

      Force xcodebuild to use specified Code Sign Identity.

      Specify code signing identity as full ID (e.g. `Mac Developer: Bitrise Bot (VV2J4SV8V4)`)
      or specify code signing group ( `Mac Developer` or `Mac Distribution` ).

      You also have to **specify the Identity in the format it's stored in Xcode project settings**,
      and **not how it's presented in the Xcode.app GUI**!
      **The input is case sensitive**: `Mac Distribution` works but `mac distribution` does not!

  opts:
    category: force archive codesign settings
    description: |-
      Used for Xcode version 8 and above.

      Force xcodebuild to use specified Provisioning Profile.

      How to get your Provisioning Profile Specifier:

      - In Xcode make sure you disabled `Automatically manage signing` on your project's `General` tab
      - Now you can select your Provisioning Profile Specifier's name as `Provisioning Profile` input value on your project's `General` tab
      - `force_provisioning_profile_specifier` input value build up by the Team ID and the Provisioning Profile Specifier name, separated with slash character ('/'): `TEAM_ID/PROFILE_SPECIFIER_NAME`

      Format example:

      - `1MZX23ABCD4/My Provisioning Profile`
    title: Force code signing with Provisioning Profile Specifier
- force_provisioning_profile: null
  opts:
    category: force archive codesign settings
    description: |-
      Force xcodebuild to use the specified Provisioning Profile.

      Use Provisioning Profile's UUID. The profile's name is not accepted by xcodebuild.

      How to get your UUID:

      - In Xcode select your project -> Build Settings -> Code Signing
      - Select the desired Provisioning Profile, then scroll down in profile list and click on Other...
      - The popup will show your profile's UUID.

      Format example:

      - c5be4123-1234-4f9d-9843-0d9be985a068
