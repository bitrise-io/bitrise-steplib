      The file name depends on the reporter that was selected, for example for the
      `junit` reporter, the generated file name will be `swiftlint_report.xml`, and
      for the `html` reporter it will be `swiftlint_report.html`). This is useful
      if you want to have this report in a separate file and do something with it,
      for example upload to S3.
