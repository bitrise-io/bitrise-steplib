      A space-delimited list of additional options to pass to the test runner

      Example:

      If a value of `KEY1 true KEY2 false` is passed to this input,
      then it will be passed to the `adb` command like so:

      ```shell
      adb shell am instrument -e "KEY1" "true" "KEY2" "false" [...]
      ```

      See the [`adb` documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb#am) for more info.
