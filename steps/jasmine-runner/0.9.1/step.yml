summary: Runs Jasmine tests.
description: "Perform unit testing with our **Jasmine Test Runner** Step. \nIf your
  Cordova/Ionic project has Jasmine dependency in its package.json file, the **Jasmine
  Test Runner** Step will get automatically inserted in your Workflow. \nIf the dependency
  is missing from your project, you can manually insert the **Jasmine Test Runner**
  Step from our StepLib.\n\n### Configuring the Step\n1. Provide your project's working
  directory in the **Working directory** input.\n3. Add custom options in `jasmine
  [options]` in the **Options to append to the jasmine command** input.\n\n### Troubleshooting\nMake
  sure you insert the **Jasmine Test Runner** Step right after **Run npm command**
  or **Run yarn command package manager** Step.\n\n\n### Useful links\n- [Getting
