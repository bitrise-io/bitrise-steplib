      Use this option if the fastlane directory is not in your repository's root.

      Working directory should be the parent directory of your Fastfile's directory.

      Example:

      * If Fastfile path: `./here/is/my/fastlane/Fastfile`
      * Then Fastfile's directory: `./here/is/my/fastlane`
      * So Working Directory should be: `./here/is/my`
