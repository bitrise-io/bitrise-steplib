summary: Runs your fastlane lane on [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io).

  fastlane is an open-source app automation tool for iOS, Android and for most cross-platform frameworks, for example, React Native, Xamarin and Flutter.
  **fastlane** Step helps you integrate your lane to your Bitrise Workflow and runs your lane based on the fastlane actions with minimal configuration.
  If your Apple Developer Portal account is connected to Bitrise, the `FASTLANE_SESSION` Environment Variable will pass on the session data to fastlane.

  ### Configuring the Step
  1. Add the **fastlane** Step to your Workflow after the **Git Clone Repository** Step or any other dependency Step.
  1. Based on your project's fastlane setup, you can add your project's default lane or a custom lane in the **fastlane lane** input.
  2. If your fastlane directory is not available in your repository's root, then you can add the parent directory of fastlane directory in the **Working directory** input.
  3. If your project doesn't contain a fastlane gem in your project's Gemfile, you can use the **Should update fastlane gem before run** input.
  Set this input to `true` so that the Step can install the latest fastlane version to your project.
  If a gem lockfile (Gemfile.lock or gems.locked) includes the fastlane gem in the working directory, that specific fastlane version will be installed.
  4. Select `yes` in the **Enable verbose logging** input if you wish to run your build in debug mode and print out error additional debug logs.
  5. Select `yes` in the **Enable collecting files to be included in the build cache** to cache pods, Carthage and Android dependencies.

  ### Troubleshooting
  If you run your lane on Bitrise and your build fails on the **fastlane** Step, the logs won't reveal too much about the error since it's most likely related to the fastlane file's configuration.
  We recommend you swap your fastlane actions for Bitrise Steps which will bring out the problem.

      Use this option if the fastlane directory is not in your repository's root.

      Working directory should be the parent directory of your Fastfile's directory.

      For example:

      * If the Fastfile path is `./here/is/my/fastlane/Fastfile`
      * Then the Fastfile's directory is `./here/is/my/fastlane`
      * So the Working Directory should be `./here/is/my`
