      defines which configuration (Debug, Release, ...) should be used,

      **Make sure that the Configuration you specify actually exists
      in your Xcode Project**. If it does not, if you have a typo
      in the value of this input Xcode will simply use the Configuration
      specified by the Scheme and will silently ignore this parameter!
