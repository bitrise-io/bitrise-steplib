title: Set Xcode Project Build Number
summary: Set the value of your iOS app's build number to the specified version number.
description: |-
  Set the value of your iOS app's build number to the specified version number. A great way to keep track of versions
  when submitting bug reports.

  If your IPA contains multiple build targets, they need to have the same version number as your app's main target has.
  In that case, you need to add this Step to your Workflow for each build target: if you have, say, three targets, you need to have three instances of this Step in your Workflow.
  If there are targets with different version numbers the app cannot be submitted for App Review or Beta App Review.

  ### Configuring the Step

  The step can handle if versions numbers are specified in the project file (default configuration since Xcode 13) and the old style
  where the version numbers appear in the **Info.plist** file. It can automatically detect which style is used and act accordingly.

  For the simple projects you do not need to do anything because the step uses the previously defined $BITRISE_PROJECT_PATH
  and $BITRISE_SCHEME env vars to detect the target settings.

  For better customisation the step can be also instructed to look for a specific target and even for specific target configurations
  to update the version numbers.
