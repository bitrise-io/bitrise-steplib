  Saves Swift Package Manager dependency cache. This Step needs to be used in combination with **Restore SPM Cache**.

  This Step is based on [key-based caching](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/en/builds/caching/key-based-caching.html) and sets up the cache key and path automatically for SPM dependencies. If you'd like to change the cache key (or paths to cache), you might want to use the generic [Save cache](https://github.com/bitrise-steplib/bitrise-step-save-cache) Step instead.
